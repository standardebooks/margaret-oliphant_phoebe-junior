<h3>THE PASTOR'S PROGRESS.</h3>

<p>Miss Phœbe Tozer, the only daughter of the chief deacon
and leading member of the Dissenting connection in Carlingford,
married, shortly after his appointment to the charge of
Salem Chapel, in that town, the Reverend Mr. Beecham, one
of the most rising young men in the denomination. The
marriage was in many ways satisfactory to the young lady's
family, for Mr. Beecham was himself the son of respectable
people in a good way of business, and not destitute of means;
and the position was one which they had always felt most
suitable for their daughter, and to which she had been almost,
it may be said, brought up. It is, however, scarcely necessary
to add that it was not quite so agreeable to the other leading
members of the congregation. I should be very sorry to say
that each family wished that preferment for its own favourite
daughter; for indeed there can be no doubt, as Mrs. Pigeon
asserted vigorously, that a substantial grocer, whose father
before him had established an excellent business, and who had
paid for his pew in Salem as long as any one could recollect, and
supported every charity, and paid up on all occasions when
extra expense was necessary, was in every way a more desirable
son-in-law than a poor minister who was always dependent on
pleasing the chapel folks, and might have to turn out any day.
Notwithstanding, however, the evident superiority of the
establishment thus attained by Maria Pigeon, there is a certain
something attached to the position of a clerical caste, even
among such an independent body as the congregation at Salem
Chapel, which has its own especial charms, and neither the
young people who had been her companions nor the old people
who had patronized and snubbed her, felt any satisfaction in
seeing Phœbe thus advanced over them to the honours and
glories inalienable from the position of minister's wife. All
her little airs of bridal vanity were considered as so many
offensive manifestations of delight and exultation in her rise in
life. Her <i>trousseau</i>, though pronounced by all competent judges
not half so abundant or fine as Maria Pigeon's, still called forth
comments which nobody ventured to indulge in, in respect to
the grocer's blooming bride. A grocer's lady has a right to
anything her parents can afford; but to see a minister's wife
swelling herself up, and trying to ape the quality, filled the
town with virtuous indignation. The sight of young Mrs.
Beecham walking about with her card-case in her hand, calling
on the Miss Hemmingses, shaking hands with Mrs. Rider the
doctor's wife, caused unmitigated disgust throughout all the
back streets of Carlingford; and “<i>that</i> Phœbe a-sweeping in as
if the chapel belonged to her,” was almost more than the oldest
sitter could bear. Phœbe, it must be added, felt her elevation
to the full, and did not spare her congregation. Sometimes she
would have the audacity to walk from the vestry to the pew, as
if she were an office-bearer, instead of coming in humbly by the
door as became a woman. She would sit still ostentatiously
until every one had gone, waiting for her husband. She quite
led the singing, everybody remarked, paying no more attention
to the choir than if it did not exist; and once she had even paused
on her way to her seat, and turned down the gas, which was
blazing too high, with an air of proprietorship that nobody
could endure.</p>

<p>“Does Salem belong to them Tozers, I should like to know?”
said Mrs. Brown. “Brown would never be outdone by him
in subscriptions you may be sure, nor Mr. Pigeon neither, if
the truth was known. I never gave my money to build a castle
for the Tozers.”</p>

<p>Thus the whole congregation expressed itself with more or
less eloquence, and though the attendance never diminished,
everybody being too anxious to see “what they would do next,”
the feeling could not be ignored. Phœbe herself, with a
courage which developed from the moment of her marriage,
took the initiative.</p>

<p>“It never answers,” she said, solemnly, “to marry one of the
flock; I knew it, Henery, and I told you so; and if you would
be so infatuated, and marry me when I told you not, for your
own interests—”</p>

<p>“They're all jealous of you, my pet, that's what it is,” said
Mr. Beecham, and laughed. He could bear the annoyance in
consideration of that sweet consciousness of its cause which
stole over all his being. Phœbe laughed, too, but not with so
delicious a gratification. She felt that there were people, even
in Salem, who might be jealous of him.</p>

<p>“The end of it all is, we must not stay here,” she said.
“You must find another sphere for your talents, Henery, and
I'm sure it will not be difficult. If you get put on that deputation
that is going down to the North, suppose you take a few
of your best sermons, dear. That can never do any harm—indeed
it's sure to do good, to some poor benighted soul at
least, that perhaps never heard the truth before. And likewise,
perhaps, to some vacant congregation. I have always
heard that chapels in the North were very superior to here.
A different class of society, and better altogether. These
Pigeons and Browns, and people are not the sort of society for
you.”</p>

<p>“Well, there's truth in that,” said Mr. Beecham, pulling
up his shirt-collar. “Certainly it isn't the sort of thing one
was accustomed to.” And he lent a serious ear to the suggestion
about the sermons. The consequence was that an
invitation followed from a chapel in the North, where indeed
Mrs. Phœbe found herself in much finer society, and grew
rapidly in importance and in ideas. After this favourable start,
the process went on for many years by which a young man
from Homerton was then developed into the influential and
highly esteemed pastor of an important flock. Things may
be, and probably are, differently managed now-a-days. Mr.
Beecham had unbounded fluency and an unctuous manner of
treating his subjects. It was eloquence of a kind, though not
of an elevated kind. Never to be at a loss for what you have
to say is a prodigious advantage to all men in all positions, but
doubly so to a popular minister. He had an unbounded
wealth of phraseology. Sentences seemed to melt out of his
mouth without any apparent effort, all set in a certain cadence.
He had not, perhaps, much power of thought, but it is easy to
make up for such a secondary want when the gift of expression
is so strong. Mr. Beecham rose, like an actor, from a long
and successful career in the provinces, to what might be called
the Surrey side of congregational eminence in London; and
from thence attained his final apotheosis in a handsome chapel
near Regent's Park, built of the whitest stone, and cushioned
with the reddest damask, where a very large congregation sat
in great comfort and listened to his sermons with a satisfaction
no doubt increased by the fact that the cushions were soft as
their own easy-chairs, and that carpets and hot-water pipes
kept everything snug under foot.</p>

<p>It was the most comfortable chapel in the whole connection.
The seats were arranged like those of an amphitheatre, each
line on a slightly higher level than the one in front of it, so
that everybody saw everything that was going on. No dimness
or mystery was wanted there; everything was bright daylight,
bright paint, red cushions, comfort and respectability.
It might not be a place very well adapted for saying your
prayers in, but then you could say your prayers at home—and
it was a place admirably adapted for hearing sermons in,
which you could not do at home; and all the arrangements
were such that you could hear in the greatest comfort, not
to say luxury. I wonder, for my own part, that the poor
folk about did not seize upon the Crescent Chapel on the
cold Sunday mornings, and make themselves happy in those
warm and ruddy pews. It would be a little amusing to
speculate what all the well-dressed pew-holders would have
done had this unexpected answer to the appeal which Mr.
Beecham believed himself to make every Sunday to the world
in general, been literally given. It would have been extremely
embarrassing to the Managing Committee and all
the office-bearers, and would have, I fear, deeply exasperated
and offended the occupants of those family pews; but fortunately
this difficulty never did occur. The proletariat of
Marylebone had not the sense or the courage, or the profanity,
which you will, to hit upon this mode of warming themselves.
The real congregation embraced none of the unwashed multitude.
Its value in mere velvet, silk, lace, trinkets, and furs
was something amazing, and the amount these comfortable
people represented in the way of income would have amounted
to a most princely revenue. The little Salems and Bethesdas,
with their humble flocks, could not be supposed to belong to
the same species; and the difference was almost equally marked
between such a place of worship as the Crescent Chapel and
the parish churches, which are like the nets in the Gospel, and
take in all kinds of fish, bad and good. The pew-holders in the
Crescent Chapel were universally well off; they subscribed
liberally to missionary societies, far more liberally than the
people in St. Paul's close by did to the S. P. G. They had
everything of the best in the chapel, as they had in their houses.
They no more economized on their minister than they did on
their pew-cushions, and they spent an amount of money on
their choir which made the singing-people at St. Paul's gnash
their teeth. From all this it will be seen that the atmosphere
of the Crescent Chapel was of a very distinct and individual
kind. It was a warm, luxurious air, perfumy, breathing of
that refinement which is possible to mere wealth. I do not
say there might not be true refinement besides, but the surface
kind, that which you buy from upholsterers and tailors and
dressmakers, which you procure ready made at schools, and
which can only be kept up at a very high cost, abounded and
pervaded the place. Badly dressed people felt themselves out
of place in that brilliant sanctuary; a muddy footprint upon
the thick matting in the passages was looked at as a crime.
Clean dry feet issuing out of carriage or cab kept the aisles
unstained, even on the wettest day. We say cab, because
many of the people who went to the Crescent Chapel objected
to take out their own carriages or work their own horses on
Sunday; and there were many more who, though they did not
possess carriages, used cabs with a freedom incompatible with
poverty. As a general rule, they were much better off than
the people at St. Paul's, more universally prosperous and well-to-do.
And they were at the same time what you might safely
call well-informed people—people who read the newspapers,
and sometimes the magazines, and knew what was going on.
The men were almost all liberal in politics, and believed in Mr.
Gladstone with enthusiasm; the women often “took an interest”
in public movements, especially of a charitable character.
There was less mental stagnation among them probably than
among many of their neighbours. Their life was not profound
nor high, but still it was life after a sort. Such was the flock
which had invited Mr. Beecham to become their pastor when
he reached the climax of his career. They gave him a very
good salary, enough to enable him to have a handsome house in
one of the terraces overlooking Regent's Park. It is not a
fashionable quarter, but it is not to be despised in any way.
The rooms were good-sized and lofty, and sometimes have been
known to suffice for very fine people indeed, a fact which the
Beechams were well aware of; and they were not above the
amiable weakness of making it known that their house was in
a line with that of Lady Cecilia Burleigh. This single fact of
itself might suffice to mark the incalculable distance between
the Reverend Mr. Beecham of the Crescent Chapel, and the
young man who began life as minister of Salem in Carlingford.
And the development outside was not less remarkable than the
development within.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how our prejudices change from youth to
middle age, even without any remarkable interposition of
fortune; I do not say dissipate, or even dispel, which is much
more doubtful—but they change. When Mr. and Mrs.
Beecham commenced life, they had both the warmest feeling
of opposition to the Church and everything churchy. All the
circumstances of their lives had encouraged this feeling. The
dislike of the little for the great, the instinctive opposition of a
lower class towards the higher, intensified that natural essence
of separatism, that determination to be wiser than one's neighbour,
which in the common mind lies at the bottom of all
dissent. In saying this we no more accuse Dissenters in
religion than Dissenters in politics, or in art, or in criticism.
The first dissenter in most cases is an original thinker, to
whom his enforced departure from the ways of his fathers is
misery and pain. Generally he has a hard struggle with himself
before he can give up, for the superlative truth which has
taken possession of him, all the habits, the pious traditions of
his life. He is the real Nonconformist—half martyr, half
victim, of his convictions. But that Nonconformity which has
come to be the faith in which a large number of people are
trained is a totally different business, and affects a very different
kind of sentiments. Personal and independent conviction
has no more to do with it than it has to do with the ardour of
a Breton peasant trained in deepest zeal of Romanism, or the
unbounded certainty of any other traditionary believer. For
this reason we may be allowed to discuss the changes of feeling
which manifested themselves in Mr. and Mrs. Beecham without
anything disrespectful to Nonconformity. Not being persons
of original mind, they were what their training and circumstances,
and a flood of natural influences, made them. They
began life, feeling themselves to be of a hopelessly low social
caste, and believing themselves to be superior to their superiors
in that enlightenment which they had been brought up to believe
distinguished the connection. The first thing which opened
their minds to a dawning doubt whether their enlightenment
was, in reality, so much greater than that of their neighbours,
was the social change worked in their position by their removal
from Carlingford. In the great towns of the North, Dissent
attains its highest social elevation, and Chapel people are no
longer to be distinguished from Church people except by the
fact that they go to Chapel instead of Church, a definition so
simple as to be quite overwhelming to the unprepared dissenting
intelligence, brought up in a little Tory borough, still
holding for Church and Queen. The amazing difference which
this made in the sentiments of Mrs. Phœbe Beecham, <i>née</i>
Tozer, it is quite impossible to describe. Her sudden introduction
to “circles” which Mrs. Pigeon had never entered, and
to houses at the area-door of which Mr. Brown, the dairyman,
would have humbly waited, would have turned the young
woman's head, had she not felt the overpowering necessity of
keeping that organ as steady as possible, to help her to hold
her position in the new world. Phœbe was a girl of spirit, and
though her head went round and round, and everything felt
confused about her, she did manage desperately to hold her
own and to avoid committing herself; but I cannot attempt to
tell how much her social elevation modified her sectarian zeal.
Phœbe was only a woman, so that I am free to assign such
motives as having a serious power over her. Let us hope Mr.
Beecham, being a man and a pastor, was moved in a more
lofty, intellectual, and spiritual way.</p>

<p>But however that may be, the pair went conjugally together
in this modification of sentiment, and by the time they reached
the lofty eminence of the Crescent Chapel, were as liberal-minded
Nonconformists as heart could desire. Mr. Beecham
indeed had many friends in the Low, and even some in the
Broad Church. He appeared on platforms, to promote various
public movements, along with clergymen of the Church. He
spoke of “our brethren within the pale of the Establishment”
always with respect, sometimes even with enthusiasm. “Depend
upon it, my dear Sir,” he would even say sometimes to a
liberal brother, “the Establishment is not such an unmitigated
evil as some people consider it. What should we do in country
parishes where the people are not awakened? They do the
dirty work for us, my dear brother—the dirty work.” These
sentiments were shared, but perhaps not warmly, by Mr.
Beecham's congregation, some of whom were hot Voluntaries,
and gave their ministers a little trouble. But the most part
took their Nonconformity very quietly, and were satisfied to
know that their chapel was the first in the connection, and
their minister justly esteemed as one of the most eloquent.
The Liberation Society held one meeting at the Crescent
Chapel, but it was not considered a great success. At the
best, they were no more than lukewarm Crescent-Chapelites,
not political dissenters. Both minister and people were
Liberal, that was the creed they professed. Some of the congregations
Citywards, and the smaller chapels about Hampstead
and Islington, used the word Latitudinarian instead; but
that, as the Crescent Chapel people said, was a word always
applied by the bigoted and ignorant to those who held in high
regard the doctrines of Christian charity. They were indeed
somewhat proud of their tolerance, their impartiality, their
freedom from old prejudices. “That sort of thing will not do
now-a-days,” said Mr. Copperhead, who was a great railway
contractor and one of the deacons, and who had himself a son
at Oxford. If there had been any bigotry in the Crescent,
Mr. Copperhead would have had little difficulty in transferring
himself over the way to St. Paul's Church, and it is astonishing
what an effect that fact had upon the mind of Mr.
Beecham's flock.</p>

<p>Mr. Beecham's house was situated in Regent's Park, and
was constructed on the ordinary model of such houses. On
the ground-floor was a handsome dining-room, a room which
both Mr. and Mrs. Beecham twenty years before would have
considered splendid, but which now they condescended to, as
not so large as they could wish, but still comfortable. The
drawing-room above was larger, a bright and pleasant room,
furnished with considerable “taste.” Behind the dining-room,
a smaller room was Mr. Beecham's study, or the library, as it
was sometimes called. It was lined with book-cases containing
a very fair collection of books, and ornamented with portraits
(chiefly engravings) of celebrated ministers and laymen
in the connection, with a bust of Mr. Copperhead over the
mantelpiece. This bust had been done by a young sculptor
whom he patronized, for the great man's own house. When
it was nearly completed, however, a flaw was found in the
marble, which somewhat detracted from its perfection. The
flaw was in the shoulder of the image, and by no means
serious; but Mr. Copperhead was not the man to pass over
any such defect. After a long and serious consultation over
it, which made the young artist shake in his shoes, a solution
was found for the difficulty.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, Sir,” said Mr. Copperhead; “I'll give it to
the minister. It'll look famous in his little study. Works of
art don't often come his way; and you'll get a block of the
best, Mr. Chipstone—the very best, Sir, no expense spared—and
begin another for me.”</p>

<p>This arrangement was perfectly satisfactory to all parties,
though I will not say that it was not instrumental in bringing
about certain other combinations which will be fully discussed
in this history. The Beechams were mightily surprised when
the huge marble head, almost as large as a Jupiter, though perhaps
not otherwise so imposing, arrived at the Terrace; but they
were also gratified.</p>

<p>“It is quite like receiving us into his own family circle,” Mrs.
Beecham said with a glance at her daughter, Phœbe, junior,
who, with all her pink fingers outspread, was standing in adoration
before that image of wealth and fabulous luxury.</p>

<p>“What a grand head it is!” cried the young enthusiast,
gazing rapt upon the complacent marble whisker so delightfully
curled and bristling with realistic force.</p>

<p>“It looks well, I must say, it looks well,” said Mr. Beecham
himself, rubbing his hands, “to receive such a token of respect
from the leading member of the flock.” And certainly no more
perfect representation of a bell-wether ever adorned any shepherd's
sanctuary.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_II"/>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>THE LEADING MEMBER.</h3>


<p>Mr. Copperhead, to whom so much allusion has been made,
was a well-known man in other regions besides that of the
Crescent Chapel. His name, indeed, may be said to have gone
to the ends of the earth, from whence he had conducted lines
of railway, and where he had left docks, bridges, and light-houses
to make him illustrious. He was one of the greatest
contractors for railways and other public works in England,
and, by consequence, in the world. He had no more than a
very ordinary education, and no manners to speak of; but at
the same time he had that kind of faculty which is in practical
work what genius is in literature, and, indeed, in its kind is
genius too, though it neither refines nor even (oddly enough)
enlarges the mind to which it belongs. He saw the right track
for a road through a country with a glance of his eye; he
mastered all the points of nature which were opposed to him
in the rapidest survey, though scientifically he was great in no
branch of knowledge. He could rule his men as easily as if
they were so many children; and, indeed, they were children
in his hands. All these gifts made it apparent that he must
have been a remarkable and able man; but no stranger would
have guessed as much from his appearance or his talk. There
were people, indeed, who knew him well, and who remained
incredulous and bewildered, trying to persuade themselves that
his success must be owing to pure luck, for that he had nothing
else to secure it. The cause of this, perhaps, was that he knew
nothing about books, and was one of those jeering cynics who
are so common under one guise or another. Fine cynics are
endurable, and give a certain zest often to society, which might
become too civil without them; but your coarse cynic is not
pleasant. Mr. Copperhead's eye was as effectual in quenching
emotion of any but the coarsest kind as water is against fire.
People might be angry in his presence—it was the only passion
he comprehended; but tenderness, sympathy, sorrow, all the
more generous sentiments, fled and concealed themselves when
this large, rich, costly man came by. People who were brought
much in contact with him became ashamed of having any feelings
at all; his eye upon them seemed to convict them of humbug.
Those eyes were very light grey, prominent, with a jeer
in them which was a very powerful moral instrument. His
own belief was that he could “spot” humbug wherever he saw
it, and that nothing could escape him; and, I suppose, so much
humbug is there in this world that his belief was justified. But
there are few more awful people than those ignoble spectators
whose jeer arrests the moisture in the eye, and strangles the
outcry on their neighbour's lip.</p>

<p>Mr. Copperhead had risen from the ranks; yet not altogether
from the ranks. His father before him had been a contractor,
dealing chiefly with canals and roads, and the old kind of public
works; a very rough personage indeed, but one to whose fingers
gold had stuck, perhaps because of the clay with which they
were always more or less smeared. This ancestor had made a
beginning to the family, and given his son a name to start with.
<i>Our</i> Mr. Copperhead had married young, and had several sons,
who were all in business, and all doing well; less vigorous, but
still moderately successful copies of their father. When, however,
he had thus done his duty to the State, the first Mrs.
Copperhead having died, he did the only incomprehensible
action of his life—he married a second time, a feeble, pretty,
pink-and-white little woman, who had been his daughter's
governess; married her without rhyme or reason, as all his
friends and connections said. The only feasible motive for this
second union seemed to be a desire on Mr. Copperhead's part
to have something belonging to him which he could always jeer
at, and in this way the match was highly successful. Mrs.
Copperhead the second was gushing and susceptible, and as
good a butt as could be imagined. She kept him in practice
when nobody else was at hand. She was one of those naturally
refined but less than half-educated, timid creatures who are to
be found now and then painfully earning the bread which is
very bitter to them in richer people's houses, and preserving in
their little silent souls some fetish in the shape of a scrap of
gentility, which is their sole comfort, or almost their sole comfort.
Mrs. Copperhead's fetish was the dear recollection
that she was “an officer's daughter;” or rather this had
been her fetish in the days when she had nothing, and was
free to plume herself on the reflected glory. Whether in
the depths of her luxurious abode, at the height of her good
fortune, she still found comfort in the thought, it would
be hard to tell. Everybody who had known her in her youth
thought her the most fortunate of women. Her old school
companions told her story for the encouragement of their
daughters, as they might have told a fairy tale. To see her
rolling in her gorgeous carriage, or bowed out of a shop where
all the daintiest devices of fashion had been placed at her feet,
filled passers-by with awe and envy. She could buy whatever
she liked, festoon herself with finery, surround herself
with the costliest knick-knacks; the more there were of them,
and the costlier they were, the better was Mr. Copperhead
pleased. She had everything that heart could desire. Poor
little woman! What a change from the governess-chrysalis
who was snubbed by her pupil and neglected by everybody!
and yet I am not sure that she did not—so inconsistent is
human nature—look back to those melancholy days with a sigh.</p>

<p>This lady was the mother of Clarence Copperhead, the young
man who was at Oxford, her only child, upon whom (of course)
she doted with the fondest folly; and whom his father jeered
at more than at any one else in the world, more even than at
his mother, yet was prouder of than of all his other sons and
all his possessions put together. Clarence, whom I will not
describe, as he will, I trust, show himself more effectually by
his actions, was like his mother in disposition, or so, at least,
she made herself happy by thinking; but by some freak of nature
he was like his father in person, and carried his mouse's
heart in a huge frame, somewhat hulking and heavy-shouldered,
with the same roll which distinguished Mr. Copperhead, and
which betrayed something of the original navvy who was the
root of the race. He had his father's large face too, and a
tendency towards those demonstrative and offensive whiskers
which are the special inheritance of the British Philistine. But
instead of the large goggle eyes, always jeering and impudent,
which lighted up the paternal countenance, Clarence had a pair
of mild brown orbs, repeated from his mother's faded face,
which introduced the oddest discord into his physiognomy
generally. In the family, that is to say among the step-brothers
and step-sisters who formed Mr. Copperhead's first
family, the young fellow bore no other name than that of the
curled darling, though, indeed, he was as far from being curled
as any one could be. He was not clever; he had none of the
energy of his race, and promised to be as useless in an office as
he would have been in a cutting or a yard full of men. I am
not sure that this fact did not increase secretly his father's
exultation and pride in him. Mr. Copperhead was fond of
costly and useless things; he liked them for their cost, with an
additional zest in his sense of the huge vulgar use and profit of
most things in his own life. This tendency, more than any
appreciation of the beautiful, made him what is called a patron
of art. It swelled his personal importance to think that he
was able to hang up thousands of pounds, so to speak, on his
walls, knowing all the time that he could make thousands more
by the money had he invested it in more useful ways. The
very fact that he could afford to refrain from investing it, that
he could let it lie there useless, hanging by so many cords and
ribbons, was sweet to him. And so also it was sweet to him
to possess a perfectly useless specimen of humanity, which had
cost him a great deal, and promised to cost him still more.
He had plenty of useful sons as he had of useful money. The
one who was of no use was the apex and glory of the whole.</p>

<p>But these three made up a strange enough family party, as
may be supposed. The original Copperheads, the first family,
who were all of the same class and nature, would have made a
much noisier, less peaceable household; but they would have
been a much jollier and really more harmonious one. Mr.
Copperhead himself somewhat despised his elder sons, who
were like himself, only less rich, less vigorous, and less self-assertive.
He saw, oddly enough, the coarseness of their manners,
and even of their ways of thinking; but yet he was a great
deal more comfortable, more at his ease among them, than he
was when seated opposite his trembling, deprecating, frightened
little wife, or that huge youth who cost him so much and
returned him so little. Now and then, at regular periodical
intervals, the head of the family would go down to Blackheath
to dine and spend the night with his son Joe, the second and
the favourite, where there were romping children and a portly,
rosy young matron, and loud talk about City dinners, contracts,
and estimates. This refreshed him, and he came home with
many chuckles over the imperfections of the family.</p>

<p>“My sons buy their wives by the hundred-weight,” he would
say jocularly at breakfast the day after; “thirteen stone if she
is a pound, is Mrs. Joe. Expensive to keep up in velvet and
satin, not to speak of mutton and beef. Your mother comes
cheap,” he would add aside to Clarence, with a rolling laugh.
Thus he did not in the least exempt his descendants from the
universal ridicule which he poured on all the world; but when
he sat down opposite his timid little delicate wife, and by his
University man, who had very little on the whole to say for
himself, Mr. Copperhead felt the increase in gentility as well as
the failure in jollity. “You are a couple of ghosts after Joe
and his belongings, you two. Speak louder, I say, young fellow.
You don't expect me to hear that penny-whistle of
yours,” he would say, chuckling at them, with a mixture of
pride and disdain. They amused him by their dulness and
silence, and personal awe of him. He was quite out of his
element between these two, and yet the very fact pleasantly
excited his pride.</p>

<p>“I speak as gentlemen generally speak,” said Clarence, who
was sometimes sullen when attacked, and who knew by experience
that his father was rarely offended by such an argument.</p>

<p>“And I am sure, dear, your papa would never wish you to
do otherwise,” said anxious Mrs. Copperhead, casting a furtive
frightened glance at her husband. He rolled out a mighty
laugh from the head of the table where he was sitting. He
contemplated them with a leer that would have been insulting,
had he not been the husband of one and the father of the
other. The laugh and the look called forth some colour on
Mrs. Copperhead's cheek, well as she was used to them; but
her son was less susceptible, and ate his breakfast steadily, and
did not care.</p>

<p>“A pretty pair you are,” said Mr. Copperhead. “I like
your gentility. How much <i>foie gras</i> would you eat for breakfast,
I wonder, my lad, if you had to work for it? Luckily for
you, I wasn't brought up to talk, as you say, like a gentleman.
I'd like to see you managing a field of navvies with that nice
little voice of yours—ay, or a mob before the hustings, my boy.
You're good for nothing, you are; a nice delicate piece of china
for a cupboard, like your mother before you. However, thank
Heaven, we've got the cupboard,” he said with a laugh, looking
round him; “a nice big 'un, too, well painted and gilded; and
the time has come, through not talking like a gentleman, that
I can afford you. You should hear Joe. When that fellow
talks, his house shakes. Confounded bad style of house, walls
like gingerbread. How the boards don't break like pie-crust
under Mrs. Joe's fairy foot, I can't make out. By Jove, ma'am,
one would think I starved you, to see you beside your daughter-in-law.
Always had a fine healthy appetite had Mrs. Joe.”</p>

<p>There was nothing to answer to this speech, and therefore a
dead silence ensued. When the master of the house is so distinctly
the master, silence is apt to ensue after his remarks.
Mrs. Copperhead sipped her tea, and Clarence worked steadily
through his breakfast, and the head of the family crumpled the
Times, which he read at intervals. All sorts of jokes had gone
on at Joe's table the morning before, and there had been peals
of laughter, and Mrs. Joe had even administered a slap upon
her husband's ruddy cheek for some pleasantry or other. Mr.
Copperhead, as he looked at his son and his wife, chuckled behind
the Times. When they thought he was occupied they
made a few gentle remarks to each other. They had soft voices,
with that indescribable resemblance in tone which so often
exists between mother and son. Dresden china; yes, that was
the word; and to see his own resemblance made in that delicate
<i>pâte</i>, and elevated into that region of superlative costliness,
tickled Mr. Copperhead, and in the most delightful way.</p>

<p>“How about your ball?” was his next question, “or Clarence's
ball, as you don't seem to take much interest in it,
ma'am? You are afraid of being brought in contact with the
iron pots, eh? You might crack or go to pieces, who knows,
and what would become of me, a wretched widower.” Mr.
Copperhead himself laughed loudly at this joke, which did not
excite any mirth from the others, and then he repeated his
question, “How about the ball?”</p>

<p>“The invitations are all sent out, Mr. Copperhead; ninety-five—I—I
mean a hundred and thirty-five. I—I beg your
pardon, they were in two lots,” answered the poor woman nervously.
“A hundred and thirty-eight—and there is—a few
more—”</p>

<p>“Take your time, ma'am, take your time, we'll get at the
truth at last,” said her husband; and he laid down his paper
and looked at her. He was not angry nor impatient. The
twinkle in his eye was purely humorous. Her stumblings
amused him, and her nervousness. But oddly enough, the most
furious impatience could not have more deeply disconcerted her.</p>

<p>“There are a few more—some old friends of mine,” she went
on, confused. “They were once rather—kind—took an interest;
that is—”</p>

<p>“Oh, the baronet and his daughters,” said Mr. Copperhead,
“by all means let's have the baronet and his daughters.
Though as for their taking an interest—if you had not been a
rich man's wife, ma'am, living in a grand house in Portland
Place—”</p>

<p>“It was not now,” she said, hurriedly. “I do not suppose
that any one takes an interest—in me now—”</p>

<p>Mr. Copperhead laughed, and nodded his head. “Not
many, ma'am, I should think—not many. You women must
make up your minds to that. It's all very well to take an interest
in a pretty girl; but when you come to a certain age—Well,
let's proceed, the baronet—”</p>

<p>“And his two girls—”</p>

<p>“Ah, there's two girls! that's for you, Clarence, my boy. I
thought there must be a motive. Think that fellow a good
<i>parti</i>, eh? And I would not say they were far wrong if he
behaves himself. Make a note of the baronet's daughter,
young man. Lord, what a world it is!” said Mr. Copperhead,
reflectively. “I should not wonder if you had been
scheming, too.”</p>

<p>“I would not for the world!” cried the poor little woman,
roused for once. “I would not for anything interfere with a
marriage. That is the last thing you need fear from me.
Whether it was a girl I was fond of, or a girl I disliked—so
long as she was Clarence's choice. Oh, I know the harm that
is done by other people's meddling—nothing, nothing, would
induce me to interfere.”</p>

<p>Mr. Copperhead laid down his paper, and looked at her. I
suppose, however little a man may care for his wife, he does
not relish the idea that she married him for anything but love.
He contemplated her still with amused ridicule, but with something
fiercer in his eyes. “Oh—h!” he said, “you don't like
other people to interfere? not so much as to say, it's a capital
match, eh? You'll get so and so, and so and so, that you
couldn't have otherwise—carriages perhaps, and plenty of
money in your pocket (which it may be you never had in your
life before), and consideration, and one of the finest houses in
London, let us say in Portland Place. You don't like that
amount of good advice, eh? Well, I do—I mean to interfere
with my son, to that extent at least—you can do what you like.
But as you're a person of prodigious influence, and strong will,
and a great deal of character, and all that,” Mr. Copperhead
broke out with a rude laugh, “I'm afraid of you, I am—quite
afraid.”</p>

<p>Fortunately, just at this moment his brougham came round,
and the great man finished his coffee at a gulp, and got up.
“You look out for the baronet's daughters, then—” he said,
“and see all's ready for this ball of yours; while I go and
work to pay the bills, that's my share. You do the ornamental,
and I do the useful, ha, ha! I'll keep up my share.”</p>

<p>It was astonishing what a difference came upon the room the
moment he disappeared. Somehow it had been out of harmony.
His voice, his look, his heavy person, even his whiskers had
been out of character. Now the air seemed to flutter after the
closing of the door like water into which something offensive
has sunk, and when the ripples of movement were over the large
handsome room had toned down into perfect accord with its
remaining inhabitants. Mrs. Copperhead's eyes were rather
red—not with tears, but with the inclination to shed tears,
which she carefully restrained in her son's presence. He still
continued to eat steadily—he had an admirable appetite. But
when he had finished everything on his plate, he looked up and
said, “I hope you don't mind, mamma; I don't suppose you
do; but I don't like the way my father speaks to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear!” cried the mother, with an affected little
smile, “why should I mind? I ought to know by this time that
it's only your papa's way.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so—but I don't like it,” said the young man,
decisively. He did not notice, however, as after second thoughts
he returned to the game-pie, that his mother's eyes were redder
than ever.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_III"/>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>MR. COPPERHEAD'S BALL.</h3>


<p>This ball was an event, not only in Mr. Copperhead's household,
but even in the connection itself, to which the idea of balls,
as given by leading members of the flock, was somewhat novel.
Not that the young people were debarred from that amusement,
but it was generally attained in a more or less accidental
manner, and few professing Christians connected with the
management of the chapel had gone the length of giving such
an entertainment openly and with design. Mr. Copperhead,
however, was in a position to triumph over all such prejudices.
He was so rich that any community would have felt it ought to
extend a certain measure of indulgence to such a man. Very
wealthy persons are like spoilt children, their caprices are
allowed to be natural, and even when we are angry with them
we excuse the vagaries to which money has a right. This
feeling of indulgence goes a very great way, especially among
the classes engaged in money-making, who generally recognize
a man's right to spend, and feel the sweetness of spending more
acutely than the hereditary possessors of wealth. I do not
believe that his superior knowledge of the best ways of using
money profitably ever hinders a money-making man from lavish
expenditure; but it gives him a double zest in spending, and
it makes him, generally, charitable towards the extravagances
of persons still richer than himself. A ball, there was no doubt,
was a worldly-minded entertainment, but still, the chapel reflected,
it is almost impossible not to be a little worldly-minded
when you possess such a great share of the world's goods, and
that, of course, it could not be for himself that Mr. Copperhead
was doing this, but for his son. His son, these amiable casuists
proceeded, was being brought up to fill a great position, and no
doubt society did exact something, and as Mr. Copperhead had
asked all the chief chapel people, his ball was looked upon with
very indulgent eyes. The fact that the minister and his family
were going staggered some of the more particular members a
little, but Mr. Beecham took high ground on the subject and
silenced the flock. “The fact that a minister of religion is one
of the first persons invited, is sufficient proof of the way our
friend means to manage everything,” said the pastor. “Depend
upon it, it would be good for the social relations of the country
if your pastors and teachers were always present. It gives at
once a character to all the proceedings.” This, like every other
lofty assertion, stilled the multitude. Some of the elder ladies,
indeed, groaned to hear, even at the prayer-meetings, a whisper
between the girls about this ball and what they were going to
wear; but still it was Christmas, and all the newspapers, and
a good deal of the light literature which is especially current
at that season, persistently represented all the world as in a
state of imbecile joviality, and thus, for the moment, every objection
was put down.</p>

<p>To nobody, however, was the question, what to wear, more
interesting than to Phœbe, junior, who was a very well-instructed
young woman, and even on the point of dress had theories of
her own. Phœbe had, as her parents were happy to think,
had every advantage in her education. She had possessed a
German governess all to herself, by which means, even Mr.
Beecham himself supposed, a certain amount of that philosophy
which Germans communicate by their very touch must have got
into her, besides her music and the language which was her
primary study. And she had attended lectures at the ladies'
college close by, and heard a great many eminent men on a
great many different subjects. She had read, too, a great deal.
She was very well got up in the subject of education for women,
and lamented often and pathetically the difficulty they lay under
of acquiring the highest instruction; but at the same time she
patronized Mr. Ruskin's theory that dancing, drawing, and
cooking were three of the higher arts which ought to be studied
by girls. It is not necessary for me to account for the discrepancies
between those two systems, in the first place because
I cannot, and in the second place, because there is in the
mind of the age some ineffable way of harmonizing them
which makes their conjunction common. Phœbe was restrained
from carrying out either to its full extent. She
was not allowed to go in for the Cambridge examinations because
Mr. Beecham felt the connection might think it strange
to see his daughter's name in the papers, and, probably, would
imagine he meant to make a schoolmistress of her, which he
thanked Providence he had no need to do. And she was not
allowed to educate herself in the department of cooking, to
which Mrs. Beecham objected, saying likewise, thank Heaven,
they had no need of such messings; that she did not wish her
daughter to make a slave of herself, and that Cook would not
put up with it. Between these two limits Phœbe's noble ambition
was confined, which was a “trial” to her. But she did
what she could, bating neither heart nor hope. She read
Virgil at least, if not Sophocles, and she danced and dressed
though she was not allowed to cook.</p>

<p>As she took the matter in this serious way, it will be understood
that the question of dress was not a mere frivolity with her.
A week before the ball she stood in front of the large glass in
her mother's room, contemplating herself, not with that satisfaction
which it is generally supposed a pretty young woman
has in contemplating her own image. She was decidedly a
pretty young woman. She had a great deal of the hair of the
period, nature in her case, as (curiously, yet very truly) in so
many others, having lent herself to the prevailing fashion. How
it comes about I cannot tell, but it is certain that there does
exist at this present moment, a proportion of golden-haired girls
which very much exceeds the number we used to see when
golden hair had not become fashionable—a freak of nature
which is altogether independent of dyes and auriferous fluid, and
which probably has influenced fashion unawares. To be sure
the pomades of twenty years ago are, Heaven be praised! unknown
to this generation, and washing also has become the
fashion, which accounts for something. Anyhow, Phœbe,
junior, possessed in perfection the hair of the period. She had,
too, the complexion which goes naturally with those sunny
locks—a warm pink and white, which, had the boundaries between
the pink and the white been a little more distinct, would
have approached perfection too. This was what she was
thinking when she looked at herself in her mother's great glass.
Mrs. Beecham stood behind her, more full-blown and more
highly-coloured than she, but very evidently the rose to which
this bud would come in time. Phœbe looked at her own reflection,
and then at her mother's, and sighed such a profound
sigh as only lungs in the most excellent condition could produce.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” she said, with an accent of despair, “I am too
pink, a great deal too pink! What am I to do?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, my pet,” said Mrs. Beecham; “you have a lovely
complexion;” and she threw a quantity of green ribbons which
lay by over her child's hair and shoulders. A cloud crossed
the blooming countenance of Phœbe, junior. She disembarrassed
herself of the ribbons with another sigh.</p>

<p>“Dear mamma,” she said, “I wish you would let me read
with you now and then, about the theory of colours, for instance.
Green is the complementary of red. If you want to
bring out my pink and make it more conspicuous than ever, of
course you will put me in a green dress. No, mamma, dear,
not that—I should look a fright; and though I dare say it does
not matter much, I object to looking a fright. Women are, I
suppose, more ornamental than men, or, at least, everybody
says so; and in that case it is our duty to keep it up.”</p>

<p>“You are a funny girl, with your theories of colour,” said
Mrs. Beecham. “In my time, fair girls wore greens and blues,
and dark girls wore reds and yellows. It was quite simple.
Have a white tarlatan, then; every girl looks well in that.”</p>

<p>“You don't see, mamma,” said Phœbe, softly, suppressing in
the most admirable manner the delicate trouble of not being
understood, “that a thing every girl looks well in, is just the
sort of thing that no one looks <i>very</i> well in. White shows no
invention. It is as if one took no trouble about one's dress.”</p>

<p>“And neither one ought, Phœbe,” said her mother. “That
is very true. It is sinful to waste time thinking of colours and
ribbons, when we might be occupied about much more important
matters.”</p>

<p>“That is not my opinion at all,” said Phœbe. “I should like
people to think I had taken a great deal of trouble. Think of
all the trouble that has to be taken to get up this ball!”</p>

<p>“I fear so, indeed; and a great deal of expense,” said Mrs.
Beecham, shaking her head. “Yes, when one comes to think
of that. But then, you see, wealth has its duties. I don't
defend Mr. Copperhead—”</p>

<p>“I don't think he wants to be defended, mamma. I think it
is all nonsense about wasting time. What I incline to, if you
won't be shocked, is black.”</p>

<p>“Black!” The suggestion took away Mrs. Beecham's
breath. “As if you were fifty! Why, I don't consider myself
old enough for black.”</p>

<p>“It is a pity,” said Phœbe, with a glance at her mother's full
colours; but that was really of so much less importance.
“Black would throw me up,” she added seriously, turning to
the glass. “It would take off this pink look. I don't mind
it in the cheeks, but I am pink all over; my white is pink.
Black would be a great deal the best for both of us. It would
tone us down,” said Phœbe, decisively, “and it would throw us
up.”</p>

<p>“But for you, a girl under twenty, my dear—”</p>

<p>“Mamma, what does it matter? The question is, am I to
look my best? which I think is my duty to you and to Providence;
or am I just,” said Phœbe, with indignation, “to look
a little insipidity—a creature with no character—a little girl
like everybody else?”</p>

<p>The consequence of this solemn appeal was that both the
Phœbes went to Mr. Copperhead's ball in black; the elder in
velvet, with Honiton lace (point, which Phœbe, with her artistic
instincts, would have much preferred, being unattainable); the
younger in tulle, flounced to distraction, and largely relieved
with blue. And the consequence of this toilette, and of the
fact that Phœbe did her duty by her parents and by Providence,
and looked her very best, was that Clarence Copperhead fell a
hopeless victim to her fascinations, and scarcely could be induced
to leave her side all night. The ball was about as
remarkable a ball as could have been seen in London. The
son of the house had contemplated with absolute despair the
list of invitations. He had deprecated the entertainment
altogether. He had said, “We know nobody,” with a despairing
impertinence which called forth one of his father's roars of
laughter. And though Mr. Copperhead had done all he could
to assume the position of that typical Paterfamilias who is
condemned to pay for those pleasures of his family which are
no pleasure to him, yet common-sense was too much for him,
and everybody felt that he was in reality the giver and
enjoyer of the entertainment. It was Mr., not Mrs. Copperhead's
ball. It was the first of the kind which had ever
taken place in his house; the beginning of a new chapter
in his social existence. Up to this moment he had not shown
any signs of being smitten with that craze for “Society,”
which so often and so sorely affects the millionnaire. He had
contented himself hitherto with heavy and showy dinners,
costing Heaven knows how much a head (Mr. Copperhead
knew, and swelled visibly in pride and pleasure as the cost
increased), which he consumed in company with twenty people
or so of kindred tastes to himself, who appreciated the cost and
understood his feelings. On such people, however, his Dresden
china was thrown away. Joe and Mrs. Joe were much more in
their way than the elegant University man and the well-bred
mother, who was “a poor little dowdy,” they all said. Therefore
the fact had been forced upon Mr. Copperhead that his
circle must be widened and advanced, if his crowning glories
were to be appreciated as they deserved.</p>

<p>The hunger of wealth for that something above wealth which
the bewildered rich man only discovers the existence of when
he has struggled to the highest pinnacle of advancement in his
own way, began to seize this wealthy neophyte. To be sure,
in this first essay, the company which he assembled in his fine
rooms in Portland Place, to see all his fine things and celebrate
his glory, was not a fine company, but they afforded more
gratification to Mr. Copperhead than if they had been ever so
fine. They were people of his own class, his old friends,
invited to be dazzled, though standing out to the utmost of
their power, and refusing, so far as in them lay, to admit how
much dazzled they were. It was a more reasonable sort of
vanity than the commoner kind, which aims at displaying its
riches to great personages, people who are not dazzled by
any extent of grandeur, and in whose bosoms no jealousy is
excited towards the giver of the feast. Mr. Copperhead's
friends had much more lively feelings; they walked about
through the great rooms, with their wives on their arms, in a
state of semi-defiance, expressing no admiration, saying to each
other, “This must have cost Copperhead a pretty penny,” as
they met in doorways; while the ladies put their flowery
and jewelled heads together and whispered, “Did you ever see
such extravagance? And what a dowdy <i>she</i> is with it all!”
This was the under-current of sentiment which flowed strong
in all the passages, and down the rapids of the great staircase;
a stream of vigorous human feeling, the existence of which
was as deeply gratifying to the entertainer as the sweetest
flattery. The lord and the ladies who might have been tempted
to his great house would not have had a thought to spare for
Mr. Copperhead; but the unwilling applause of his own class
afforded him a true triumph.</p>

<p>Amid this throng of people, however, there could be little
doubt that the one young lady who attracted his son was
the least eligible person there, being no other than Phœbe
Beecham, the pastor's daughter. Almost the only other
utterly ineligible girl was a pale little maiden who accompanied
Sir Robert Dorset and his daughters, and who was
supposed to be either their governess or their humble companion.
The Dorsets were the only people who had any
pretensions to belong to “society,” in all those crowded
rooms. They were distantly related to Mrs. Copperhead, and
had been, she gratefully thought, kind to her in her youth, and
they had no particular objection to be kind to her now that she
was rich, though the Baronet, as Mr. Copperhead always called
him, winced at so rampant a specimen of wealth, and “the
girls” did not see what good it was to keep up relations with
a distant cousin, who though so prodigiously rich was of no
possible use, and could neither make parties for them, nor
chaperon them to the houses of the great. When they had
received her present invitation, they had accepted it with
surprise and hesitation. Chance only had brought them to
London at that time of the year, the most curious time surely
to choose for a ball, but convenient enough as affording a little
amusement at a season when little amusement was ordinarily
to be had. Sir Robert had consented to go, as a man with no
occupation elsewhere might consent to go to the Cannibal
Islands, to see how the savages comported themselves. And
little Ursula May, another poor relative on the other side of
the house, whom they had charitably brought up to town with
them, might go too, they decided, to such a gathering. There
was no Lady Dorset, and the girls were “girls” only by
courtesy, having passed the age to which that title refers.
Such good looks as they had were faded, and they were indifferently
dressed. This last circumstance arose partly from the
fact that they never dressed very well, and partly because they
did not think it necessary to put themselves to much trouble
for poor Mrs. Copperhead's ball. Their little companion,
Ursula, was in a white frock, the sort of dress which Phœbe
had rebelled against. She was all white and had never been
to a ball before. This little party, which represented the
aristocracy at the Copperhead's ball, went to the entertainment
with a little expectation in their minds: What sort of people
would be there? Would they be “frights?” They were not
likely to be interesting in any other way, the Miss Dorsets
knew; but to little Ursula a ball was a ball, and meant delight
and glory she was aware, though she did not quite know how.
The expectations of the party, however, were strangely disappointed.
Instead of being “a set of frights,” Mrs. Copperhead's
guests were found to be resplendent in toilette. Never,
even under a ducal roof, had these ladies found themselves in
such a gorgeous assembly, and never before, perhaps, even at
the Duchess's grandest receptions, had they been unable to
discover a single face they knew. Sir Robert was even more
appalled by this discovery than his daughters were. He put
up his glass and peered more and more wistfully into the
crowd. “Don't know a soul,” he repeated at intervals. Poor
Sir Robert! he had not thought it possible that such an event
could happen to him within the four seas. Accordingly the
Dorsets clung, somewhat scared, to Mrs. Copperhead's side,
and Ursula along with them, who looked at the crowd still
more wistfully than Sir Robert did, and thought how nice it
would be to know somebody. Unfortunately the Miss Dorsets
were not attractive in personal appearance. Clarence Copperhead,
though he was not indifferent to a baronet, was yet not
sufficiently devoted to the aristocracy to do more than dance
once, as was his bounden duty, with each of the sisters. “It
seems so strange not to know any one,” these ladies said.
“Isn't it?” said Clarence. “<i>I</i> don't know a soul.” But
then he went off and danced with Phœbe Beecham, and the
Miss Dorsets stood by Mrs. Copperhead, almost concealing
behind them the slight little snow-white figure of little Ursula
May.</p>

<p>Clarence was a very well-behaved young man on the whole.
He knew his duty, and did it with a steady industry, working
off his dances in the spirit of his navvy forefather. But he
returned between each duty dance to the young lady in black,
who was always distinguishable among so many young ladies
in white, and pink, and green, and blue. The Miss Dorsets
and Ursula looked with interest and something like envy at
that young lady in black. She had so many partners that she
scarcely knew how to manage them all, and the son of the
house returned to her side with a pertinacity that could not
pass unremarked. “Why should one girl have so much and
another girl so little?” Ursula said to herself; but, to be
sure, she knew nobody, and the young lady in black knew
everybody. On the whole, however, it became evident to
Ursula that a ball was not always a scene of unmixed delight.</p>

<p>“It is very kind of you to remember what old friends we
are,” said Phœbe. “But, Mr. Clarence, don't be more good
to me than you ought to be. I see your mother looking for
you, and Mr. Copperhead might not like it. Another time,
perhaps, we shall be able to talk of old days.”</p>

<p>“There is no time like the present,” said the young man,
who liked his own way. I do not mean to say that it was
right of Phœbe to dance with him, especially dances she had
promised to other people. But he was the personage of the
evening, and that is a great temptation. Mr. Copperhead
himself came up to them more than once, with meaning in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Don't be too entertaining, Miss Phœbe,” he said; for he
saw no reason why he should not speak plainly in his own
house, especially to the minister's daughter. “Don't be too
entertaining. This is Clarence's ball, and he ought to be civil
to other people too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, please go away!” cried Phœbe, after this admonition.
But Clarence was sullen, and stood his ground.</p>

<p>“We are going to have our waltz out,” he said. “It is not
my ball a bit—let him entertain his people himself. How
should I know such a set of guys? I know nobody but you
and the Dorset girls, who are in society. Parents are a mistake,”
said the young man, half rebellious, half sullen, “they
never understand. Perhaps you don't feel that, but I should
think girls must see it sometimes as well as men.”</p>

<p>“Girls don't use such strong expressions,” said Phœbe,
smiling, as they flew off in the uncompleted waltz. She danced
very well, better than most of the ladies present, and that was
the reason Clarence assigned to his mother for his preference
of her. But when Mr. Copperhead saw that his remonstrance
was unheeded by the young people, he went up to Mrs.
Beecham, with a rich man's noble frankness and courage. “I
am delighted to see you here, ma'am, and I hope you have remarked
how well Miss Phœbe is entertaining my boy. Do
you see them dancing? She's been away from you a long time,
Mrs. Beecham, as girls will when they get hold of somebody
that pleases them. Shouldn't you like me to go and fetch her
back?” Mrs. Beecham, with cheeks that were very full blown
indeed, and required a great deal of fanning, called back her
child to her side at the end of that dance. She scolded Phœbe
behind her fan, and recalled her to a sense of duty. “A pastor's
daughter has to be doubly particular,” she said; “what if
your poor papa was to get into trouble through your thoughtlessness?”</p>

<p>“I was not thoughtless, mamma; forgive me for answering
back,” said Phœbe, very meekly; and she showed no signs of
sulkiness, though Clarence was carried off and kept from approaching
her again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, when Clarence was removed from
Phœbe, he fell into still greater peril. The eldest Miss Dorset
and her mother, both of them with equally benevolent intentions,
introduced him simultaneously to Ursula May. “The
poor little girl has not danced once,” Mrs. Copperhead, who
had recollections of standing by herself for a whole evening,
unnoticed, whispered in his ear, and Miss Dorset spoke to him
still more plainly. “We brought her,” she said, “but I cannot
get her partners, for I don't know anybody.” And what
could Clarence do but offer himself? And Ursula, too, was a
good dancer, and very pretty—far prettier than Phœbe.</p>

<p>“Confound him! there he is now for ever with that girl in
white,” said his father to himself, with great rage. Dozens of
good partners in pink and blue were going about the room.
What did the boy mean by bestowing himself upon the two
poor ones, the black and the white. This disturbed Mr.
Copperhead's enjoyment, as he stood in the doorway of the
ball-room, looking round upon all the splendour that was his,
and feeling disposed, like Nebuchadnezzar, to call upon everybody
to come and worship him. He expanded and swelled out
with pride and complacency, as he looked round upon his own
greatness, and perceived the effect made upon the beholders.
When that effect did not seem sufficiently deep, he called here
and there upon a lingerer for applause. “That's considered a
very fine Turner,” he said, taking one of them into a smaller
room. “Come along here, you know about that sort of thing—I
don't. I should be ashamed to tell you how much I gave
for it; all that money hanging there useless, bringing in
nothing! But when I do buy anything I like it to be the very
best that is to be had.”</p>

<p>“I'd as soon have a good chromo,” said the person addressed,
“which costs a matter of a five-pound note, and enough too, to
hang up against a wall. But you can afford it, Copperhead.
You've the best right of any man I know to be a fool if you
like.”</p>

<p>The great man laughed, but he scarcely liked the compliment.
“I am a fool if you like,” he said, “the biggest fool going. I
like a thing that costs a deal, and is of no use. That's what I
call luxury. My boy, Clarence, and my big picture, they're
dear; but I can afford 'em, if they were double the price.”</p>

<p>“If I were you,” said his friend, “I wouldn't hang my picture
in this little bit of a hole, nor let my boy waste his time
with all the riff-raff in the room. There's Smith's girl and
Robinson's niece, both of them worth a cool hundred thousand;
and you leave him to flourish about all over the place with a
chit in a white frock, and another in a black one. I call that
waste, not luxury, for my part.”</p>

<p>“I don't want to sell either the boy or the picture,” said the
rich man, with a laugh. But nevertheless he was annoyed that
his son should be such an ass. Miss Smith and Miss Robinson
were as fine as their milliners could make them. The first of
these ladies had an emerald locket almost as big as a warming-pan,
and Miss Robinson's pearls were a little fortune in themselves;
but the chosen objects of that young idiot's attentions
wore nothing but trumpery twopenny-halfpenny trinkets, and
gowns which had been made at home for all Mr. Copperhead
knew. Confound him! the father breathed hotly to himself.
Thus it will be seen that unmixed pleasure is not to be had in
this world, even in the midst of envious friends and the most
splendid entertainment which money could supply.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IV"/>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>A COUNTRY PARTY.</h3>


<p>“Very funny, now,” said Sir Robert. “I don't know that
such a thing ever happened to me before. Give you my word
for it, I didn't know a single soul, not one; and there must
have been a couple of hundred or so there. Jove! I never
thought there were as many people in England that I didn't
know.”</p>

<p>“How could you know Mr. Copperhead's friends?” said
Sophy Dorset. “What I wonder is, that she should have asked
us. Not but that it was amusing enough, once in a way, just
to see how such people look.”</p>

<p>“They looked very much like other people, my dear. Finer,
though. I haven't seen so many jewels at an evening party
for ages. Very much like other people. Fatter, perhaps, the
men, but not the women. I notice,” said Sir Robert, who himself
was spare, “that City men generally have a tendency to
fat.”</p>

<p>“They are so rich,” said Miss Dorset, with gentle disgust.</p>

<p>She was the quiet one, never saying much. Sophy, who was
lively, conducted the conversation. They were all seated at
breakfast, later than usual, on the morning after the Copperheads'
ball. It was a hazy morning, and the party were seated
in a large sitting-room in the “very central” locality of Suffolk
Street, looking down that straight little street upon the stream
of carriages and omnibuses in the foggy distance. It was not
for pleasure that this country party had come to London. Sir
Robert's second son, who was in India, had sent his eldest
children home to the care of his father and sisters. They were
expected at Portsmouth daily, and the aunts, somewhat excited
by the prospect of their charge, had insisted upon coming to
town to receive them. As for Ursula May, who was a poor
relation on the late Lady Dorset's side, as Mrs. Copperhead
had been a poor relation on Sir Robert's, London at any season
was a wonder and excitement to her, and she could not sufficiently
thank the kind relations who had given her this holiday
in her humdrum life. She was the daughter of a poor clergyman
in the little town of Carlingford, a widower with a large
family. Ursula was the eldest daughter, with the duties of a
mother on her much burdened hands; and she had no special
inclination towards these duties, so that a week's escape from
them was a relief to her at any time. And a ball! But the
ball had not been so beatific as Ursula hoped. In her dark
blue serge dress, close up to the throat and down to the wrists,
she did not look so pale as she had done in her snow-white
garments on the previous night; but she was at the best of
times a shadowy little person, with soft, dark brown hair, dark
brown eyes, and no more colour than the faintest of wild rose
tints; but the youthfulness, and softness, and roundness of the
girl showed to full advantage beside the more angular development
of the Miss Dorsets, who were tall, and had lost the first
smooth curves of youth. To Ursula, not yet twenty, these
ladies looked very mature, almost aged, being one of them ten,
and the other eight years older than herself. She looked up to
them with great respect; but she felt, all the same—how could
she help it?—that in some things, though the Miss Dorsets
were her superiors, it was best to be Ursula May.</p>

<p>“Poor Clara!” said Sir Robert. “She was always a frightened
creature. When I recollect her, a poor little governess,
keeping behind backs at the nursery parties—and to see her in
all her splendour now!”</p>

<p>“She would keep behind backs still, if she could,” said Miss
Dorset.</p>

<p>“Think of that, Ursula,” cried Sophy; “there is an example
for you. She was a great deal worse off than you are; and to
see her now, as papa says! You may have a house in Portland
Place too, and ask us to balls, and wear diamonds. Think of
that! Though last night you looked as frightened as she.”</p>

<p>“Don't put such demoralizing ideas into the child's head.
How it is that girls are not ruined,” said Miss Dorset, shaking
her head, “ruined! by such examples, I cannot tell. They must
have stronger heads than we think. As poor as Cinderella one
day, and the next as rich as the Queen—without any merit of
theirs, all because some chance man happens to take a fancy to
them.”</p>

<p>“Quite right,” said Sir Robert; “quite right, my dear. It
is the natural course of affairs.”</p>

<p>Miss Dorset shook her head. She went on shaking her head
as she poured out the tea. She was not given to eloquence,
but the subject inspired her.</p>

<p>“Don't think of it, Ursula; it is not the sort of thing that
good girls ought to think of,” and the elder sister made signs
to Sophy, who was reckless, and did not mind the moral effect
of the suggestion.</p>

<p>“Poor Mrs. Copperhead! I shall never have a house in
Portland Place, nor any diamonds, except Aunt Mary's old
brooch. I shall live and die an old maid, and nobody will waste
a thought upon me,” said Sophy, who made this prophecy at
her ease, not expecting it to come true; “but I don't envy
poor Clara, and if you marry such a man as Mr. Copperhead,
though I shall admire you very much, Ursula, I shan't envy
you.”</p>

<p>“Is young Mr. Copperhead as bad as his father?” said
Ursula, simply.</p>

<p>She was so far from thinking what meaning could be attached
to her words, that she stopped and looked, wondering, from one
to another when they laughed.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” said Sir Robert; “not so bad, either!”</p>

<p>Poor Ursula was extremely serious. She turned with relief
to Miss Dorset, who was serious too.</p>

<p>“My dear, we don't know much about Clarence; he is a
heavy young man. I don't think he is attractive. Have you
had a letter from the Parsonage this morning?” said Anne
Dorset, with a very grave face; and as it turned out that
Ursula had a letter, Miss Dorset immediately plunged into
discussion of it. The girl did not understand why the simple
little epistle should be so interesting, nor did she perceive yet
what the laughter was about. To tell the truth, Ursula, who
was not clever, had thought young Mr. Copperhead very <i>nice</i>.
He had asked her to dance when nobody else did; he had
talked to her as much as he could have talked to Sophy Dorset
herself. He had rehabilitated her in her own eyes after the
first disappointment and failure of the evening, and she was
prepared to think, whatever might be said about the father,
that the son was “very kind” and very agreeable. Why
should they laugh? Ursula concluded that there must be
some private joke of their own about Clarence (what a pretty,
interesting, superior name Clarence was!) which she could not
be permitted to know.</p>

<p>“If you talk like that,” said Anne Dorset to Sophy, “you
will set her little head afloat about good matches, and spoil
her too.”</p>

<p>“And a very good thing,” said Sophy. “If you had put the
idea into my head, I should not be Sophy Dorset now. Why
shouldn't she think of a good match? Can she live there for
ever in that dreadful Parsonage, among all those children whom
she does not know how to manage? Don't be absurd, Anne;
except an elder daughter like you here and there, you know,
girls must marry if they are to be of any consequence in the
world. Let them get it into their heads; we can't change
what is the course of nature, as papa says.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Sophy! it is so unwomanly.”</p>

<p>“Never mind; when a man chuckles and jeers at me because
I am unmarried, I think it is unmanly; but they all do it, and
no one finds any fault.”</p>

<p>“Not all surely; not near <i>all</i>.”</p>

<p>“Don't they? Not to our faces, perhaps; but whenever
they write, whenever they speak in public. When men are so
mean, why should we train girls up to unnatural high-mindedness?
Why, that is the sort of girl who ought to make a good
marriage; to 'catch' somebody, or have somebody 'hooked' for
her. She is pretty, and soft, and not very wise. I am doing
the very best thing in the world for her, when I laugh at love and
all that nonsense, and put a good match into her mind.”</p>

<p>Miss Dorset turned away with a sigh, and shook her head.
It was all she could do. To encounter Sophy in argument was
beyond her power, and if it had not been beyond her power,
what would have been the good of it? Sophy had a story
which, unfortunately, most people knew. She had been romantic,
and she had been disappointed. Five or six years before,
she had been engaged to a clergyman, who, finding that the
good living he was waiting for in order to marry was not likely
to come through Sir Robert's influence, intimated to his betrothed
his serious doubt whether they were likely to be happy
together, and broke off the engagement. He married somebody
else in six months, and Sophy was left to bear the shame as
she might. To be sure, a great many people were highly indignant
with him at the moment; his sin, however, was forgotten
long ago, so far as he was concerned; but nobody forgot
that Sophy had been jilted, and she did not forget it herself,
which was worse. Therefore Miss Dorset attempted no argument
with her sister. She shook her gentle head, and said
nothing. Anne was the elder sister born, the maiden-mother,
who is a clearly defined type of humanity, though rare, perhaps,
like all the finer sorts. She resolved in her own mind to take
private means for the fortification and preservation of Ursula,
whose position, as elder sister of a motherless family, interested
her especially as being like her own; but Anne owned within
herself that she had never been so young as little Ursula
May.</p>

<p>Ursula, for her part, thought very little about the question
which had thus moved her cousins. She thought Mr. Clarence
Copperhead was very nice, and that if she had but known as
many people, and had as many partners as that young lady in
black, she would have enjoyed the ball very much. After all,
now that it was over, she felt that she had enjoyed it. Three
dances were a great deal better than none at all, and to have
that pretty white frock given to her by Sir Robert was no
small matter. Besides, for in this as in other things the uses
of adversity are sometimes sweet, the pretty dress, which no
doubt would have been torn and crumpled had she danced
much, was almost quite fresh now, and would do very well at
Carlingford if there should be any balls there—events which
happened occasionally, though Ursula had never been lucky
enough to go to any of them. And Cousin Sophy had given
her a set of Venetian beads and Cousin Anne a bracelet. This
good fortune was quite enough to fill her mind with satisfaction,
and prevent any undue meditation upon good matches or the
attentions of Clarence Copperhead. Ursula was as different
as possible from Phœbe Beecham. She had no pretensions to
be intellectual. She preferred the company even of her very
smallest brothers and sisters to the conversation of her papa,
though he was known to be one of the most superior men in
the diocese. Even when her elder brother Reginald, of whom
she was very fond, came home from college, Ursula was more
than indifferent to the privileged position of elder sister, by
which she was permitted to sit up and assist at the talks which
were carried on between him and his father. Reginald was
very clever too; he was making his own way at the university
by means of scholarships, the only way in which a son of Mr.
May's was likely to get to the university at all, and to hear
him talk with his father about Greek poetry and philosophy
was a very fine thing indeed; how Phœbe Beecham, if the
chance had been hers, would have prized it; but Ursula did
not enjoy the privilege. She preferred a pantomime, or the
poorest performance in a theatre, or even Madame Tussuad's
exhibition. She preferred even to walk about the gay streets
with Miss Dorset's maid, and look into the shop-windows and
speculate what was going to be worn next season. Poor little
girl! with such innocent and frivolous tastes, it may be supposed
she did not find her position as elder sister and housekeeper
a very congenial one. Her father was no more than
Incumbent of St. Roque, an old perpetual curacy merged in a
district church, which was a poor appointment for an elderly
man with a family; he was very clever and superior, but not a
man who got on, or who did much to help his children to get
on; and had Ursula been of the kind of those who suffer and
deny themselves by nature, she would have had her hands full,
and abundant opportunity afforded her to exercise those faculties.
But she was not of this frame of mind. She did what
she was obliged to do as well as time and opportunity permitted;
but she did not throw herself with any enthusiasm into her
duties. To keep seven children in good condition and discipline
in a small house, on a small income, is more, it must be allowed,
than most girls of twenty are equal to; only enthusiasm and
self-devotion could make such a task possible, and these qualifications
poor little Ursula did not possess. Oh! how glad she
was to get away from it all, from having to think of Janey and
Johnny, and Amy and little Robin. She was not anxious
about how things might be going on in her absence, as kind
Miss Dorset thought she must be. The happiness of escaping
was first and foremost in her thoughts.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_V"/>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>SELF-DEVOTION.</h3>


<p>“Mr. Copperhead's manner is not pleasant sometimes, that
is quite true. We must make allowances, my dear. Great
wealth, you know, has its temptations. You can't expect a
man with so much money and so many people under him to
have the same consideration for other people's feelings. He
says to this man go and he goeth, and to that man come and he
cometh.”</p>

<p>“That is all very well,” said Phœbe; “but he has no right,
that I can think of, to be rude to mamma and me.”</p>

<p>“He was not exactly rude, my dear,” said Mrs. Beecham.
“We must not say he was rude. Clarence ought to have
divided his attentions more equally, we must admit, and his
father was annoyed—for the moment. I have no doubt he has
forgotten all about it long ago, and will be as pleasant as ever
next time we meet.”</p>

<p>“I am quite sure of it,” said the pastor, “and at the worst
it was but his manner—only his manner. In short, at the
committee meeting yesterday nothing could have been nicer.
He went even out of his way to send, as it were, a kind message
to Phœbe. 'I needn't ask if Miss Phœbe enjoyed herself,'
he said. Depend upon it, my dear, if there was a temporary
annoyance it is both forgotten and forgiven, so far as
Mr. Copperhead is concerned.”</p>

<p>“Forgiven!” Phœbe said to herself; but she thought it
wiser to say nothing audible on the subject. Her father and
mother, it was evident, were both disposed to extend any
amount of toleration to the leading member. It was he who
was the best judge as to what he had a right to be annoyed
about. The family party were in Mr. Beecham's study, where
the large bust of Mr. Copperhead stood on the mantelpiece, the
chief decoration. How could any one be so wicked as to rebel
against the influence of so great a personage? Phœbe had her
own ideas, but she was wise and kept them to herself.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Mrs. Beecham, solemnly, “what is to be
done, my dear, about this letter from my good papa?”</p>

<p>Phœbe was standing in front of a book-case, apparently looking
for a book. She said nothing; but it was easy to perceive
by the erectness of her shoulders, and the slight movement that
ran through her, that her attention was fully engaged.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes indeed, what about it?” the pastor said. He put
down the pen, which he had been holding in his hand by way
of symbol that, amiable as he was, his attention to his woman-kind
was an encroachment upon time which might be more usefully
employed. But this was a serious question; he had no
suggestion to offer, but he sat and twiddled his thumbs, and
looked at his wife with interest suddenly aroused.</p>

<p>“There is a great deal to be thought of,” said Mrs. Beecham,
“it is not a simple matter of family devotion. Of course if I
had no other ties, nor other duties, everything would be easy.
I should go at once to my poor suffering mamma.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beecham was a clever woman, but she had not been
able to get it out of her mind, owing to the imperfections of
her education in youth, that it was a vulgar thing to say father
and mother. “But in the present circumstances,” she continued,
her husband having given his assent to this speech, “it
is clear that I cannot do what I wish. I have you to think of,
my dear, and the children, and the duties of my position. On
the other hand, of course I could not wish, as poor mamma's
only daughter, to have my sister-in-law called in. She is not
the kind of person; she is underbred, uneducated. Of course
she would be thinking of her own children, and what would be
best for them. My parents have done all that ought to be expected
from them for Tom. Considering all things, what they
have to dispose of ought to go to Phœbe and Tozer. But Mrs.
Tom would not see that.”</p>

<p>“It is very true, my dear; I don't suppose she would,”
said Mr. Beecham, with an anxious air.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Tom,” said his wife, with some heat, “would think
her own had the first claim. She maintained it to my very
face, and after that what have we to expect? It's us that are
Tozers,” she said; “as for you, Phœbe, you belong to another
family. I put it in my own language of course, not in her
vulgar way.”</p>

<p>“It is a very serious question altogether,” said the pastor,
with some solemnity. “I don't see how you can get away, and
I don't know what is to be done.”</p>

<p>“Whatever is to be done, I won't leave poor mamma in the
hands of Mrs. Tom,” cries Mrs. Beecham, “not whatever it
costs me. She's capable of anything, that woman is. To have
her in the same town is bad enough, but in the same house
nursing poor mamma! You and I would never see a penny of
the money, Henery, nor our children—not a penny! besides
the vexation of seeing one's own parents turned against one.
I know very well how it would be.”</p>

<p>Mr. Beecham ceased twiddling his thumbs. The crisis was
too serious for that indulgence. “The position is most difficult,”
he said, “I see it all. It is easy to see it for that matter,
but to decide what are we to do is not easy. To go back to
Carlingford after so many changes, would it be good for you?”</p>

<p>“It would kill me,” said Mrs. Beecham, with energy, “you
know it would kill me. Envy drove us out, and envy would
bring me to the grave. I don't deceive myself, that is what I
see before me, if I tear myself from all my duties and go. But
on the other hand——”</p>

<p>“Listen, mamma!” cried Phœbe, turning round suddenly;
“if grandmamma is ill, and you are afraid to leave her alone,
why not send me?”</p>

<p>Both her parents turned towards Phœbe, as she spoke; they
listened to her with wonder and consternation, yet with admiring
looks. Then they looked at each other consulting,
alarmed. “You!” said Mrs. Beecham, and “You!” echoed
the pastor, repeating in his great astonishment what his wife
said.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, me—why not me? it would be only my duty,”
said Phœbe, with great composure. “And there is nothing to
keep me from going. I almost think I should like it—but
anyhow, mamma, if you think it necessary, whether I like it or
not—”</p>

<p>“Phœbe, my darling, you are the best child in the world,”
cried her mother, rising up, and going to her hastily. She
gave her a kiss of maternal enthusiasm, and then she looked
at her husband. “But should we take advantage of it?” she
said.</p>

<p>“You see, my dear,” said Mr. Beecham, hesitating, “you
might find many things different from what you are used to.
Your grandpapa Tozer is an excellent man—a most excellent
man—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said his wife, with some impatience. She was
as conscious as he was of the great elevation in the social scale
that had occurred to both of them since they left Carlingford,
and knew as well as he did that the old people had remained
stationary, while the younger ones had made such advances;
but still she did not like to hear her husband criticize her
father. What there was to be said, she preferred to say herself.
“Yes, yes,” she said, “Phœbe knows there is a difference;
they are old-fashioned folks, and don't live quite as we live.
Some things would strike you very strangely, my dear, some
things you would not like; and then Phœbe may be, for anything
I can tell, at a turning-point in her own life.”</p>

<p>“If you mean about the Copperheads, mamma, dismiss that
from your mind,” said Phœbe. “There is no sort of hurry.
We may be thrown together in after-life, and of course no one
can tell what may happen, but in the mean time there is nothing
of the sort in my mind—nor in any one else's. Do not think
of that for a moment. I am at no turning-point. I am quite
ready and quite willing to go wherever you please.”</p>

<p>Once more the parent pair looked at each other. They had
been very careful not to bring their children into contact,
since they were children, with the homelier circumstances of
the life in which they themselves had both taken their origin.
They had managed this really with great skill and discretion.
Instead of visiting the Tozers at Carlingford, they had appointed
meetings at the sea-side, by means of which the children
were trained in affectionate acquaintance with their grandparents,
without any knowledge of the shop. And Mr. Tozer,
who was only a butterman at Carlingford, presented all the
appearance of an old Dissenting minister out of it—old-fashioned,
not very refined perhaps, as Mrs. Beecham allowed,
but very kind, and the most doting of grandfathers. The wisp
of white neckcloth round his neck, and his black coat, and a
certain unction of manner all favoured the idea. Theoretically,
the young people knew it was not so, but the impression on
their imagination was to this effect. Mrs. Tozer was only
“grandmamma.” She was kind too, and if rather gorgeous in
the way of ribbons, and dressing generally in a manner which
Phœbe's taste condemned, yet she came quite within the range
of that affectionate contempt with which youth tolerates the
disadvantages of its seniors. But the butterman's shop! and
the entire cutting off from everything superior to the grocers
and poulterers of Carlingford—how would Phœbe support it?
This was what Mr. and Mrs. Beecham asked each other with
their eyes—and there was a pause. For the question was a
tremendous one, and neither knew in what way to reply.</p>

<p>“Phœbe, you are a very sensible girl—” said her father at
last, faltering.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, papa. I don't think you are treating
me as if I were sensible,” said Phœbe. “I know well enough
that grandpapa is in business—if that is what you are afraid
of—”</p>

<p>“Has been in business,” said Mrs. Beecham. “Your grandpapa
has retired for some time. To be sure,” she added, turning
to her husband, “it is only Tom that has the business, and
as I consider Mrs. Tom objectionable, Phœbe need not be
brought in contact—”</p>

<p>“If Phœbe goes to Carlingford,” said the pastor, “she must
not be disagreeable to any one. We must make up our minds
to that. They must not call her stuck up and proud.”</p>

<p>“Henery,” said Mrs. Beecham, “I can put up with a great
deal; but to think of a child of mine being exposed to the
tongues of those Browns and Pigeons and Mrs. Tom, is more
than I can bear. What I went through myself, you never
knew, nor any one breathing—the looks they gave me, the
things they kept saying, the little nods at one another every
time I passed! Was it my fault that I was better educated,
and more refined like, than they were? In Mr. Vincent's
time, before you came, Henery, he was a very gentleman-like
young man, and he used to come to the —— High Street
constantly to supper. It wasn't my doing. I never asked him—no
more than I did you!”</p>

<p>“Your father used to ask me,” said Mr. Beecham, doubtfully.
“It was very kind. A young pastor expects it in a new place;
and a great many things arise, there is no doubt, in that way.”</p>

<p>“Not by my doing,” said the lady; “and when we were
married, Henery, the things I did to please them! Thank
Heaven, they know the difference now; but if they were to set
themselves, as I could quite expect of them, against my child—”</p>

<p>“Mamma,” said Phœbe, tranquilly, “I think you forget that
it is me you are talking of. I hope I know what a pastor's
daughter owes to herself. I have had my training. I don't
think you need be frightened for me.”</p>

<p>“No; I think Phœbe could manage them if any one could,”
said her father, complacently.</p>

<p>She smiled with a gracious response to this approval. She
had a book in her hand, which of itself was a proof of Phœbe's
pretensions. It was, I think, one of the volumes of Mr. Stuart
Mill's “Dissertations.” Phœbe was not above reading novels
or other light literature, but this only in the moments dedicated
to amusement, and the present hour was morning, a time not
for amusement, but for work.</p>

<p>“Phœbe don't know Carlingford, nor the folks there,” said
Mrs. Beecham, flushed by the thought, and too much excited to
think of the elegancies of diction. She had suffered more than
her husband had, and retained a more forcible idea of the
perils; and in the pause which ensued, all these perils crowded
into her mind. As her own ambition rose, she had felt how
dreadful it was to be shut in to one small circle of very small
folks. She had felt the injurious line of separation between
the shopkeepers and the rest of the world; at least she thought
she had felt it. As a matter of fact, I think it very doubtful
whether Phœbe Tozer had felt anything of the kind; but she
thought so now; and then it was a fact that she was born
Phœbe Tozer, and was used to that life, whereas Phœbe Beecham
had no such knowledge. She had never been aware of the
limitations of a small Dissenting community in a small town,
and though she knew how much the Crescent congregation
thought of a stray millionnaire like Mr. Copperhead (a thing
which seemed too natural to Miss Beecham to leave any room
for remark), her mother thought that it might have a bad effect
upon Phœbe's principles in every way, should she find out the
lowly place held by the connection in such an old-fashioned,
self-conceited, Tory town as Carlingford. What would Phœbe
think? how would she manage to associate with the Browns
and the Pigeons? Fortunately, Mr. and Mrs. Tozer had
retired from the shop; but the shop was still there, greasy
and buttery as ever, and Mrs. Beecham's own respected papa
was still “the butterman.” How would Phœbe bear it? This
was the uppermost thought in her mind.</p>

<p>“You know, my darling,” she said afterwards, when they had
left the study, and were seated, talking it over, in the drawing-room,
“there will be a great deal to put up with. I am silly;
I don't like even to hear your papa say anything about dear
old grandpapa. He is my own, and I ought to stand up for
him; but even with grandpapa, you will have a great deal to
put up with. They don't understand our ways. They are
used to have things so different. They think differently, and
they talk differently. Even with your sense, Phœbe, you will
find it hard to get on.”</p>

<p>“I am not at all afraid, I assure you, mamma.”</p>

<p>“You are not afraid, because you don't know. I know, and
I am afraid. You know, we are not great people, Phœbe. I
have always let you know that—and that it is far finer to elevate
yourself than to be born to a good position. But when
you see really the place which poor dear grandpapa and grandmamma
think so much of, I am sure I don't know what you
will say.”</p>

<p>“I shall not say much. I shall not say anything, mamma.
I am not prejudiced,” said Phœbe. “So long as an occupation
is honest and honourable, and you can do your duty in it, what
does it matter? One kind of work is just as good as another.
It is the spirit in which it is done.”</p>

<p>“Oh, honest!” said Mrs. Beecham, half relieved, half affronted.
“Of course, it was all that. Nothing else would
have answered papa. Your uncle Tom has the—business now.
You need not go there, my dear, unless you like. I am not
fond of Mrs. Tom. We were always, so to speak, above our
station; but she is not at all above it. She is just adapted for
it; and I don't think she would suit you in the least. So except
just for a formal call, I don't think you need go there,
and even that only if grandmamma can spare you. You must
be civil to everybody, I suppose; but you need not go further;
they are not society for you. You will hear people talk of me
by my Christian name, as if we were most intimate; but don't
believe it, Phœbe. I always felt aspirations towards a very
different kind of life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don't be afraid, mamma,” said Phœbe, calmly; “I
shall be able to keep them at a distance. You need not fear.”</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear,” said the anxious mother; “but not too
much at a distance either. That is just what is so difficult. If
they can find an excuse for saying that my child is stuck up!
Oh! nothing would please them more than to be able to find
out something against my child. When you have apparently
belonged to that low level, and then have risen,” said Mrs.
Beecham, with a hot colour on her cheek, “there is nothing
these kind of people will not say.”</p>

<p>These conversations raised a great deal of thought in Phœbe's
mind; but they did not change her resolution. If it was
necessary that some one should go to look after her grandmamma,
and keep all those vulgar people at bay, and show to
the admiring world what a Dissenting minister's daughter
could be, and what a dutiful daughter was, then who so fit as
herself to be the example? This gave her even a certain
tragical sense of heroism, which was exhilarating, though serious.
She thought of what she would have to “put up with,” as of
something much more solemn than the reality; more solemn,
but alas! not so troublesome. Phœbe felt herself something
like a Joan of Arc as she packed her clothes and made her
preparations. She was going among barbarians, a set of people
who would not understand her, probably, and whom she would
have to “put up with.” But what of that? Strong in a sense
of duty, and superior to all lesser inducements, she felt herself
able to triumph. Mrs. Beecham assisted with very divided
feelings at the preparations. It was on her lips to say, “Never
mind the evening dresses; you will not want them.” But then
the thought occurred to her that to let the Carlingford folks
see what her daughter had been used to, even if she had no use
for such things, would be sweet.</p>

<p>“No, Henery; she shall take them all,” she said to her husband.
“They shall see the kind of society my child is in;
very different from their trumpery little teas! They shall see
that you and I, we grudge nothing for Phœbe—and I dare be
sworn there is not one of them like her, not even among the
quality! I mean,” said Mrs. Beecham, hastily, with a flush of
distress at her own failure in gentility, “among those who
think themselves better than we are. But Phœbe will let them
see what a pastor's family is out of their dirty little town. She
will bring them to their senses. Though I hesitated at first
when it was spoken of, I am very glad now.”</p>

<p>“Yes; Phœbe is a girl to find her level anywhere,” said the
pastor, complacently. And they forgot what she would have
to put up with in their satisfaction and admiration for herself.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VI"/>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>A MORNING CALL.</h3>


<p>Sir Robert Dorset and his daughter called, as in duty
bound, upon their relation two days after her ball. “You had
better come with us, Ursula,” said Miss Dorset. “Sophy does
not care about visits, and Mrs. Copperhead asked a great many
questions about you. She is very tender-hearted to the —— young.”
Anne had almost said to the poor, for it is difficult to
remember always that the qualifications by which we distinguish
our friends when they are not present, are not always satisfactory
to their own ears. “She was like you once, you know,”
she added, half apologetically. Ursula, who was not in the
least disposed to take offence, did not ask how, but assented, as
she would have assented had Cousin Anne told her to get
ready to go to the moon. She went upstairs and put on her
little felt hat, which had been made handsome by the long
drooping feather bestowed upon her by Sophy, and the blue
serge jacket which corresponded with her dress. She had not
any great opinion of her own good looks, but she hoped that
she was “lady-like,” notwithstanding the simplicity of her costume.
This was her only aspiration. In her heart she admired
the tall straight angular kind of beauty possessed by her
cousins, and did not think much of her own roundness and
softness, which seemed to Ursula a very inferior “style;” but
yet if she looked lady-like that was always something, and both
Sir Robert and his daughter looked at her approvingly as she
stood buttoning her gloves, waiting for them.</p>

<p>“If there are other city gentlemen there mind you make
yourself very agreeable, Ursula,” said Cousin Sophy, which
vexed the girl a little. Whether the people were city
gentlemen or not, of course, she said to herself, she would try
to be <i>nice</i>—was not that a girl's first duty? She tried for her
part to be <i>nice</i> to everybody, to talk when she could, and receive
the recompense of pleased looks. To walk with her friends up
the long line of Regent Street, with many a sidelong glance into
the shop-windows, was very pleasant to Ursula. Sometimes
even Cousin Anne would be tempted to stop and look, and
point things out to her father. Unfortunately, the things Miss
Dorset remarked were chiefly handsome pieces of furniture,
beautiful carpets, and the like, which were totally out of Ursula's
way.</p>

<p>“There is just the kind of carpet I want for the drawing-room,”
Anne said, looking at something so splendid that Ursula
thought it was good enough for the Queen. But Sir Robert
shook his head.</p>

<p>“The drawing-room carpet will do very well,” he said. “It
will last out my day, and your brother will prefer to please
himself.”</p>

<p>This brought a little cloud upon Anne Dorset's placid face,
for she too, like Mr. Beecham, had a brother whose wife it was
not agreeable to think of as mistress in the old house. She
went on quickly after that looking in at no more shops.
Perhaps she who could buy everything she wanted (as Ursula
thought) had on the whole more painful feelings in looking at
them, than had the little girl beside her, whose whole thoughts
were occupied by the question whether she would have enough
money left to buy her sister Janey one of those new neckties
which were “the fashion.” Janey did not often get anything
that was the fashion. But at any rate Ursula made notes and
laid up a great many things in her mind to tell Janey of—which
would be next best.</p>

<p>Mrs. Copperhead was seated in a corner of her vast drawing-room
when her visitors arrived, and her pale little countenance
brightened at sight of them. They were the nearest approach
to “her own people” that the poor soul possessed. She received
their compliments upon her ball with deprecating looks.</p>

<p>“I am sure you are very good—very good to say so. I am
afraid it was not much amusement to you. They were not the
kind of people—”</p>

<p>“I scarcely knew a soul,” said Sir Robert; “it was a curious
sensation. It does one good now and then to have a sensation
like that. It shows you that after all you are not such a fine
fellow as you thought yourself. Once before I experienced
something of the same feeling. It was at a ball at the Tuileries—but
even then, after a while, I found English people I knew,
though I didn't know the French grandees; but, by Jove! except
yourself and Mr. Copperhead, Clara, I knew nobody here.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Copperhead felt the implied censure more than she was
intended to feel it.</p>

<p>“Mr. Copperhead does not care about cultivating fashionable
people,” she said, with a little spirit. “He prefers his old
friends.”</p>

<p>“That is very nice of him,” cried Anne, “so much the kindest
way. I liked it so much. At most balls we go to, people
come and ask me to dance for duty, pretending not to see that
my dancing days are over.”</p>

<p>“She talks nonsense,” said Sir Robert. “Clara, I must
trust to you to put this notion out of Anne's head. Why
should her dancing days be over? I am not a Methuselah, I
hope. She has no right to shelve herself so early, has she?
I hope to see her make a good match before I die.”</p>

<p>“So long as she is happy—” said Mrs. Copperhead, faltering.
She was not any advocate for good matches. “Oh, there is
Mr. Copperhead!” she added, with a little start, as a resounding
knock was heard. “He does not often come home so early; he
will be very glad to see you, Sir Robert. Are you going to stay
long in town, Miss May?”</p>

<p>“Not long, only till the children arrive,” said Anne, looking
compassionately at the rich man's nervous wife. She had been
quiet enough, so long as she was alone. Now a little fever
seemed to be awakened in her. She turned to Ursula and
began to talk to her quickly—</p>

<p>“Do you like being in town? It is not a good time of the
year. It is nicer in May, when everything looks cheerful; but
I always live in London. You will come back for the season, I
suppose?”</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Ursula. “I never was in London before.
Cousin Anne brought me for a great pleasure. I have been twice
to the theatre, and at the ball here.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I forgot, you were at the ball—and you danced, did
you dance? I cannot remember. There were so many people.
Oh yes, I recollect. I spoke to Clarence—”</p>

<p>“I danced three times,” said Ursula. “I never was at a ball
before. It was very nice. Mr. Copperhead was so kind—”</p>

<p>“What is that about Mr. Copperhead being kind? Was
I kind? I am always kind—ask my wife, she will give me a
good character,” said the master of the house, coming up to
them. “Ah, the Baronet! how do you do, Sir Robert? I
don't often see you in my house.”</p>

<p>“You saw us the other evening,” said Sir Robert, courteously,
“and we have just come, Anne and I, to let Clara know how
much we enjoyed it. It was really splendid. I don't know
when I have seen so much—um—luxury—so great a display of—of—beautiful
things—and—and wealth.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear you were pleased,” said Mr. Copperhead, “no
expense was spared at least. I don't often throw away my
money in that way, but when I do I like things to be regardless
of expense. That is our way in the city; other people have to
make a deal of gentility go a long way, but with us, who don't
stand on our gentility—”</p>

<p>“It is not much to stand upon, certainly, in the way of giving
balls,” said Sir Robert. “I quite agree with you that money
should not be spared when a good effect is to be produced.
Anne, my dear, if you have said all you have to say to Clara,
you must recollect that we have a great deal to do—”</p>

<p>“You are not going the moment I come in,” said Mr. Copperhead.
“Come, we must have some tea or something. Not
that I care very much for tea, but I suppose you'll be shocked
if I offer you anything else in the afternoon. Haven't you ordered
tea, Mrs. Copperhead? I can't teach my wife hospitality,
Sir Robert—not as I understand it. She'd see you come and
go a dozen times, I'll be bound, without once thinking of offering
anything. That ain't my way. Tea! and directly, do you hear.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Copperhead, in a nervous tremor; “bring
tea, Burton, please. It is rather early, but I do so hope you
will stay.” She gave Miss Dorset an appealing glance, and
Anne was too kind to resist the appeal.</p>

<p>“To be sure they'll stay,” said Mr. Copperhead. “Ladies
never say no to a cup of tea, and ours ought to be good if there's
any virtue in money. Come and look at my Turner, Sir Robert.
I ain't a judge of art, but it cost a precious lot, if that is any
test. They tell me it's one of the best specimens going. Come
this way.”</p>

<p>“You won't mind?” said poor Mrs. Copperhead. “He is
very hospitable, he cannot bear that any one should go without
taking something. It is old-fashioned, but then Mr. Copperhead—”</p>

<p>“It is a most kind fashion, I think,” said Anne Dorset, who
had a superstitious regard for other people's feelings, “and
Mr. Copperhead is quite right, I never say no to a cup of tea.”</p>

<p>Just then Clarence came in with his hands in his pockets, so
curiously like his father in his large somewhat loose figure,
as unlike him in aspect and expression, that even the gentle
Anne could scarcely help smiling. When he had shaken
hands with Miss Dorset he dropped naturally into a seat beside
Ursula, who, dazzled by his position as son of the house, and
flattered by what she called his “kindness,” was as much
pleased by this sign of preference as if Clarence Copperhead
had been a hero.</p>

<p>“I hope you have recovered my father's ball,” he said.</p>

<p>“Recovered! Mr. Copperhead.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you think it uncivil; but I myself have scarcely
recovered yet. The sort of people he chose to collect—people
whom nobody knew.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Copperhead,” said Ursula, “if it was his old
friends, as your mother says, how much more noble of him
than if they had been fine people he did not care for! As
for me, I don't know any one anywhere. It was all the same
to me.”</p>

<p>“That was very lucky for you,” said the young man. “My
good cousins did not take it so easily. They are your cousins,
too?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—they are so good,” cried Ursula. “Cousin Sophy
laughs at me sometimes, but Cousin Anne is as kind as an
angel. They have always been good to us all our lives.”</p>

<p>“You live near them, perhaps? Sir Robert has been kind
enough to ask me to the Hall.”</p>

<p>“No, not near. We live at Carlingford. It is not a place
like the Dorsets'; it is a poor little town where papa is one of
the clergymen. We are not county people like them,” said
Ursula, with anxious honesty, that he might not have a false
idea of her pretensions. “I have never been anywhere all my
life, and that is why they brought me here. It was by far the
most beautiful party I ever saw,” she added, with a little
enthusiasm. “I never was at a real dance before.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you thought it pretty,” said Clarence. “I
suppose it was pretty; when the rooms are nice,” and he
looked round the handsome room, not without a little complacency,
“and when there is plenty of light and flowers, and
well-dressed people, I suppose no dance can help being a
pretty sight. That was about all. There was no one worth
pointing out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there were some very pretty people,” said Ursula;
“there was a young lady in black. She was always dancing.
I should have liked to know her. You danced with her a
great many times, Mr. Copperhead.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Clarence. He was not more foolish than his
neighbours, but it flattered him that his dancing with one
person should have been noticed, especially by a pretty creature,
who herself had attracted him and shared the privilege.
“That was Miss Beecham. I did not dance with her above
three or four times. Of course,” he said, apologetically, “we
are old friends.”</p>

<p>Ursula did not know why he should apologize. She did not
intend to flirt, not having any knowledge of that pastime as
yet. She was quite simple in her mention of the other girl,
who had attracted her attention. Now having said all she
could remember to say, she stopped talking, and her eyes
turned to the elder Mr. Copperhead, who came back, followed
by Sir Robert. There was a largeness about the rich man,
which Ursula, not used to rich men, gazed at with surprise.
He seemed to expand himself upon the air, and spread out his
large person, as she had never known any one else do. And
Sir Robert, following him, looked so strangely different. He
was very reluctant to be so led about, and, as it were, patronized
by the master of the house, and his repugnance took a curious
form. His nose was slightly drawn up, as if an odour of
something disagreeable had reached him. Ursula, in her innocence,
wondered what it was.</p>

<p>“Here's the Baronet, Clarence,” said Mr. Copperhead, who
was slightly flushed; “and he doubts the Turner being
genuine. My Turner! Go off at once to those picture people,
Christie, whatever you call them, and tell them I want proofs
that it's genuine. I am not the sort of man, by George! to
be cheated, and they ought to know that. They have had
many a hundred pounds of my money, but they shall never
have another penny if I don't get proofs. It ain't pleasant, I
can tell you, to hear the Baronet, or any one else for that
matter, running down my pictures.”</p>

<p>“I did not run it down,” said Sir Robert, with another little
curl of his nostrils. (What could there be in this grand big
house that could make a disagreeable smell?) “I only said
that I had seen copies that were so wonderfully good that
none but an expert could tell the difference; that was all. I
don't say that yours is one of them.”</p>

<p>“No; nor no one shall!” cried Mr. Copperhead. “We
shall have the experts, as you call them, and settle it. By
George! there shall be nothing uncertain in my house. You
can tell the men it is Sir Robert Dorset who suggested it.
There's nothing like a title (even when it isn't much of a
title) to keep people up to their work. Not meaning any disrespect
to Sir Robert, I could buy him and his up five times
over. But I ain't Sir Robert, and never will be. Say Sir
Robert, Clarence, my boy; that'll bear weight.”</p>

<p>“It was an unfortunate observation on my part,” said Sir
Robert, stiffly. “I have a picture myself, which I bought for
a Correggio, and which is a mere copy, I believe, though a
very nice one. I hold my tongue on the subject, and nobody
is the wiser. Anne, my dear, I think we must go now.”</p>

<p>“That would never suit me,” said the rich man; “holding
my tongue ain't my way, is it, Mrs. Copperhead? What!
going, after all, without your tea? I am afraid, ma'am, the
Baronet is touchy, and doesn't like what I said. But nobody
minds me, I assure you. I say what I think, but I don't
mean any harm.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said Anne, drawing herself up, while her father
took leave of poor little tremulous Mrs. Copperhead. “We
really must go; we have stayed longer than we meant to stay.
Ursula—”</p>

<p>“Your little companion?” said Mr. Copperhead. “Ah;
you should take care, Miss Dorset, of these little persons.
They stand in the way of the young ladies themselves often
enough, I can tell you. And so can Mrs. Copperhead; she
knows.”</p>

<p>He laughed, and both Anne and Ursula became aware that
something offensive was meant; but what it was, neither of
them could make out. Mrs. Copperhead, whose intelligence
had been quickened on that point, perceived it, and trembled
more and more.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, dear,” she said to Ursula in an agony. “Though
we are not cousins, we are connections, through your kind
Cousin Anne; for she lets me call her my Cousin Anne too.
Perhaps you will come and pay me a visit sometimes, if—if
you can be spared.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I should be very glad,” said Ursula, confused.</p>

<p>She did not understand why Sir Robert should be in such a
hurry, when both young Mr. Copperhead and his mother were
so kind. As for the other Mr. Copperhead, he did not interest
Ursula. But he went down to the door with them in an
excess of civility, offering Anne his arm, which she was obliged
to take, much against her will; and even Ursula felt a passing
pang of humiliation when the footman threw open the great
door before them, and no carriage was visible.</p>

<p>“Oh, you are walking!” said Mr. Copperhead, with one of
his big laughs.</p>

<p>After all, a laugh could hurt nobody. Why was it that
they all felt irritated and injured? Even Sir Robert grew
scarlet, and when they were outside on the broad pavement
turned almost angrily upon his daughter.</p>

<p>“I tell you what, Anne,” he said; “not if it was to save my
life, shall I ever enter that brute's doors again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa; poor Mrs. Copperhead!” cried kind Anne, with
a wail in her voice. That was all the reply she made.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VII"/>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>SHOPPING.</h3>


<p>Next day a telegram came from Southampton, announcing
the arrival of the little Dorsets, which Ursula rejoiced over
with the rest, yet was dreadfully sorry for in her heart. “Now
we shall be able to get home,” the sisters said, and she did her
best to smile; but to say that she was glad to leave London,
with all its delights, the bright streets and the shop-windows,
and the theatres, and the excitement of being “on a visit,”
would be a great deal more than the truth. She was glad,
sympathetically, and to please the others; but for herself, her
heart fell. It was still winter, and winter is not lively in
Carlingford; and there was a great deal to do at home, and
many things “to put up with.” To be sure, that was her duty,
this was only her pleasure; but at twenty, pleasure is so much
more pleasant than duty. Ursula did not at all rebel, nor did
she make painful contrasts in her mind, as so many young people
do; asking why are others so well off, and I so badly off? but
her heart sank. All the mendings, all the keepings in order, the
dinners to be invented with a due regard for the butcher's bill,
the tradespeople to be kept in good humour, the servant to be
managed, and papa, who was more difficult than the servant,
and more troublesome than the children! If Ursula sighed
over the prospect, I don't think the severest of recording angels
would put a very bad mark against her. She had been free of
all this for ten wonderful days. No torn frocks, no unpleasant
baker, no hole in the carpet, no spoiled mutton-chops, had disturbed
her repose. All these troubles, no doubt, were going
on as usual at home, and Janey and the maid were struggling
with them as best they could. Had Ursula been very high-minded
and given up to her duty, no doubt she would have
been too much moved by the thought of what her young sister
might be enduring in her absence, to get the good of her holiday;
but I fear this was not how she felt it. Janey, no doubt,
would get through somehow; and it was very sweet to escape
for ever so short a time, and have a real rest. Therefore, it
must be allowed that, when Ursula went to her bed-room after
this news arrived, she relieved herself by “a good cry.” Two
or three days longer, what difference could that have made to
those children? But after her headache was relieved in this
way, the cloud dispersed a little. The thought of all she had to
tell Janey consoled her. She counted over the spare contents of
her purse, and calculated that, after all, she would have enough
to buy the necktie; and she had all her presents to exhibit;
the ball-dress, that unhoped-for acquisition; the Venetian
beads; the bracelet, “Which is really good—<i>good</i> gold; fancy!”
said Ursula to herself, weighing it in her hand. How Janey
would be interested, how she would be dazzled! There was a
great deal of consolation in this thought. In the afternoon her
cousins took her out “shopping,” an occupation which all young
girls and women like. They bought a great many things “for
the spring,” and “for the children,” while Ursula looked on
with admiration. To be able to buy things three months in
advance, three months before they could possibly be wanted,
what luxury! and yet the Dorsets were not rich, or so, at least,
people said.</p>

<p>“Now, Ursula,” said Cousin Anne, “we have made all our
purchases. Suppose you choose frocks for the children at
home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, me?” cried poor Ursula, forgetting grammar. She
blushed very red, and looked, not without indignation, into
Anne Dorset's mild eyes. “You know I have not any money;
you know we can't afford it!” she cried, with starting tears.</p>

<p>“But I can,” said Cousin Anne; “at least, I have some
money just now. Money always goes, whether one buys things
or not,” she added, with a little sigh. “It runs through one's
fingers. When one has something to show for it, that is always
a satisfaction. Come, this would be pretty for little Amy; but
it is you who must choose.”</p>

<p>“But, Cousin Anne! Dresses! If it was a necktie or a
ribbon; but frocks—”</p>

<p>“Frocks would be most useful, wouldn't they? One for
Amy, and one for Janey. I suppose Robin does not wear
frocks now?”</p>

<p>“He has been in knickerbockers these two years,” said
Ursula, half proud, half sorry; “and the worst of it is, they
can't be made at home. Papa says, boys' clothes made at home
are always spoiled, and the tailor is so dear. Oh, Cousin
Anne, are you really, really going to be so very, very good—!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Copperhead came into the shop while they were
choosing. Poor little woman! she who trembled so in her
own house, how everybody bowed down before her at Messrs.
Margrove and Snelcher's! It was all she could do to extricate
herself from a crowd of anxious officials, all eager to supply her
with everything that heart could desire, when she saw the little
party. She came up to them, almost running in her eagerness,
her small pale face flushed, and leaned on Anne Dorset's chair
and whispered to her.</p>

<p>“You will not be angry, dear kind Anne. You are always
so good to everybody. Oh, forgive me! forgive me!”</p>

<p>Ursula could not help hearing what she said.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to forgive <i>you</i>, Mrs. Copperhead.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear Anne! But I am more than myself, you know!
He does not mean it; he never was brought up to know better.
He thinks that is how people behave—”</p>

<p>“Please don't say anything, dear Mrs. Copperhead.”</p>

<p>“Not if you will forgive—not if you will promise to forgive.
Poor Clarence is heart-broken!” cried the poor woman. “He
is so frightened for what you must think.”</p>

<p>“We don't think anything,” said Sophy, breaking in; “it is
one of our good qualities as a family that we never think.
Come and help us; we are choosing frocks for Ursula's sisters.
She has two. What are their ages, Ursula? You, who live
in town, and know the fashions, come and help us to choose.”</p>

<p>And how respectful all the shopmen grew when the nameless
country party was joined by the great Mrs. Copperhead—or
rather the great Mr. Copperhead's wife, at whose command was
unlimited credit, and all the contents of the shop if she chose.
One hurried forward to give her a chair, and quite a grand
personage, a “head man,” came from another counter to take
the charge of pleasing such a customer. Ursula could not but
look upon the whole transaction with awe. Mrs. Copperhead
was a very humble, timid woman, and Mr. Copperhead was not
nice; but it was something to command the reverence of all
the people in such a grand shop—a shop which Ursula by herself
would scarcely have ventured to enter, and in which she
felt timid and overwhelmed, saying, “Sir” to the gentleman
who was so good as to ask what she wanted. But here Mrs.
Copperhead was not afraid. She gave herself up with her
whole heart to the delightful perplexity of choice, and when
that matter was settled, looked round with searching eyes.</p>

<p>“Don't they want something else?” she said, “it is so long
since I have bought any children's things. It reminds me of
the days when Clarence was little, when I took such pride in
his dress. Come with me into the cloak room, my dear, I am
sure they must want jackets or something.”</p>

<p>Ursula resisted with pitiful looks at Cousin Anne, and Sophy
whispered into Mrs. Copperhead's ear an explanation, which,
instead of quenching her ardour, brought it up instantly to
boiling point. Her pale little languid countenance glowed
and shone. She took both Ursula's hands in hers, half smiling,
half crying.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear,” she said, “you can give me such a pleasure,
if you will! You know we are connections, almost relations.
Let me send them something. Dear children, I wish I could
see them. Come and look at the little jackets and mantles.
I have often thought, if Providence had given me a little girl,
what pleasure I should have had in dressing her. Hats too!
I am sure they must want hats. Come, my dear, come and
look at them.” Ursula did not know what to do. A little
pride and a great deal of shyness kept her back, but Mrs.
Copperhead was too much in earnest to be crossed. She
bought a couple of very smart little upper garments for Amy
and Janey, and then, clandestinely taking no one into her confidence,
for Ursula herself, and gave secret orders to have them
all sent to the Dorsets' lodgings that night. She was quite
transformed so long as this transaction lasted. Her languid
countenance grew bright, her pale eyes lighted up.</p>

<p>“You have given me such a pleasure,” she said, holding
Ursula's hands, and standing up on tip-toe to kiss her. “I am
so much obliged to you. I could almost think that Clarence
was little again, or that he had got a little sister, which was
always my heart's desire. Ah, well! often, often, it seems
better for us not to have our heart's desire, my dear; at least
I suppose that is how it must be.”</p>

<p>“I do not know how to thank you,” said Ursula, “you have
been so kind—so very kind.”</p>

<p>“I have been kind to myself,” said Mrs. Copperhead, “I
have so enjoyed it; and, my dear,” she added, with some
solemnity, still holding Ursula by the hands, “promise you will
do me one favour more. It will be such a favour. Whenever
you want anything for yourself or your sister will you write to
me? I am always in London except in autumn, and I should
so like to do your commissions. People who live in London
know how to get bargains, my dear. You must promise to let
me do them for you. It will make me so happy. Promise!”
cried the little woman, quite bright in her excitement. Ursula
looked at the two others who were looking on, and did not
know what to say.</p>

<p>“She thinks you are too expensive an agent for her,” said
Sophy Dorset, “and I think so too.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Copperhead's face faded out of its pleasant glow.</p>

<p>“There are two things I have a great deal too much of,” she
said, “money and time. I am never so happy as when I am
buying things for children, and I can see that she will trust me—won't
you, my dear? Must we say good-bye now? Couldn't
I take you anywhere? Look at that big carriage, all for me
alone, a little light woman. Let me take you somewhere. No!
Ah, Cousin Anne, you have not forgiven us for all you said.”</p>

<p>“We have some other things to do,” said Anne, drawing
back. As for Ursula, she would not at all have objected to the
splendour of the carriage. And her heart was melted by the
lonely little woman's pathetic looks. But the other ladies
stood out. They stood by while poor Mrs. Copperhead got
into the carriage and drove off, her pale reproachful little face
looking at them wistfully from the window. It was afternoon
by this time, getting dark, and it was a tolerably long walk
along the lighted, crowded streets.</p>

<p>“Cousin Anne, I am afraid we have hurt her feelings,” said
Ursula; “why wouldn't you go?”</p>

<p>“Go!” cried mild Anne Dorset; “get into that man's
carriage after yesterday? Not for the world! I can put up
with a great deal, but I can't go so far as that.”</p>

<p>“She never did any harm,” said Sophy, “poor little soul!
You see now, Ursula, don't you, how fine it is to marry a rich
man, and have everything that your heart can desire?”</p>

<p>Ursula looked at her wondering. To tell the truth, Mrs.
Copperhead's eagerness to buy everything she could think of
for the unknown children at Carlingford, the manner with
which she was regarded in the great shop, her lavish liberality,
her beautiful carriage, and all the fine things about her, had
brought Ursula to this very thought, that it was extremely fine
to marry a rich man. Sophy's irony was lost upon her simple-minded
cousin, and so indeed was Mrs. Copperhead's pathos.
That she was very kind, and that she was not very happy, were
both apparent, but Ursula did not connect the unhappiness
with the fact that she was a rich man's wife. Mr. Copperhead
certainly was not very <i>nice</i>; but when people got so old as
that, they never were very happy, Ursula thought, and what
had the money to do with it? She looked confused and puzzled
at Sophy, wondering what she meant. Yes, indeed, to marry
a rich man, to be able to buy presents for everyone, to make
the children at home perfectly happy without any trouble to
one's self! Could any one doubt that it was very nice?
Alas! Ursula did not think it at all likely that this would ever
be in her power.</p>

<p>“Poor Mrs. Copperhead!” said Anne, as they made their
way along the crowded street, where it was difficult for them
to walk together, much less to maintain any conversation.
And presently Ursula, keeping as close as possible to her
cousin's side, but compelled to make way continually for other
passers-by, lost herself in a maze of fancies, to which the misty
afternoon atmosphere, and the twinkling lights, and the quickly
passing crowds lent a confused but not unpleasing background.
She was glad that the noise made all talk impossible, and that
she could dream on quietly as they glided and pressed their
way through the current of people in Oxford Street and Regent
Street, as undisturbed as if she had been shut up in her own
room—nay, more so—for the external sights and sounds which
flitted vaguely by her, disguised those dreams even from herself.
Mrs. Copperhead had once been poorer than she was, a poor
little governess. What if somewhere about, in some beautiful
house, with just such a carriage at the door, a beautiful young
hero should be waiting who would give all those dazzling delights
to Ursula? Then what frocks she would buy, what
toys, what ornaments! She would not stop at the girls, but
drive to the best tailor's boldly, and bid him send down some
one to take Johnnie's measure, and Robin's, and even
Reginald's; and then she would go to the toy-shop, and to the
bookseller, and I can't tell where besides; and finally drive
down in the fairy chariot laden with everything that was delightful,
to the very door. She would not go in any vulgar
railway. She would keep everything in her own possession,
and give each present with her own hands—a crowning delight
which was impossible to Mrs. Copperhead—and how clearly
she seemed to see herself drawing up, with panting horses,
high-stepping and splendid, to the dull door of the poor parsonage,
where scarcely anything better than a pony-carriage ever
came! How the children would rush to the window, and
“even papa,” out of his study; and what a commotion would
run through Grange Lane, and even up into the High Street,
where the butcher and the baker would remember with a shiver
how saucy they had sometimes been—when they saw what a
great lady she was.</p>

<p>A dreamy smile hovered upon Ursula's face as she saw all
the little scenes of this little drama, mixed up with gleams of
the shop-windows, and noises of the streets, and great ghosts
of passing omnibuses, and horses steaming in the frosty air.
How many girls, like her, go dreaming about the prosaic streets?
It was not, perhaps, a very elevated or heroic dream, but the
visionary chariot full of fine things for the children, was better
than Cinderella's pumpkin carriage, or many another chariot
of romance. Her cousins, who were so much her elders, and
who shuddered in their very souls at the thought of poor Mrs.
Copperhead, and who were talking earnestly about the children
they expected next morning, and what was to be done with
them, had no clue to Ursula's thoughts. They did not think
much of them, one way or another, but took great care not to
lose her from their side, and that she should not be frightened
by the crowding, which, after all, was the great matter. And
they were very glad to get back to the comparative quiet of
Suffolk Street, and to take off their bonnets and take their cup
of tea. But Ursula, for her part, was sorry when the walk
was over. She had enjoyed it so much. It was half Regent
Street and half Carlingford, with the pleasure of both mixed up
together; and she was half little Ursula May with her head in
the air, and half that very great lady in the dream-chariot, who
had it in her power to make everybody so happy. Between
poor Mrs. Copperhead, who was the most miserable, frightened
little slave in the world, with nothing, as she said, but time and
money, and Ursula without a penny, and who always had so
much to do, what a gulf there was! a gulf, however, which
fancy could bridge over so easily. But the dream was broken
when she got indoors; not even the quiet of her own little room
could bring back in all their glory the disturbed images that
had floated before her in the street.</p>

<p>This was Ursula's last day in town, and there can be no
doubt that it was of a nature, without any aid from Sophy's
suggestion, to put a great many ideas into her mind.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_VIII"/>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>THE DORSETS.</h3>


<p>Next day the little Dorsets came, an odd little pair of shivering
babies, with a still more shivering Ayah. It was the failing
health of the little exotic creatures, endangered by their English
blood, though they had never seen England, and talked
nothing but Hindostanee, which had brought them “home” at
this inhospitable time of the year; and to get the rooms warm
enough for them became the entire thought of the anxious aunts,
who contemplated these wan babies with a curious mixture of
emotions, anxious to be “very fond” of them, yet feeling difficulties
in the way. They were very white, as Indian children
so often are, with big blue veins meandering over them, distinct
as if traced with colour. They were frightened by all the
novelty round them, and the strange faces, whose very anxiety
increased their alarming aspect; they did not understand more
than a few words of English, and shrank back in a little heap,
leaning against their dark nurse, and clinging to her when their
new relations made overtures of kindness. Children are less
easily conciliated in real life than superficial observers suppose.
The obstinate resistance they made to all Anne Dorset's attempts
to win their confidence, was enough to have discouraged
the most patient, and poor Anne cried over her failure when
those atoms of humanity, so strangely individual and distinct
in their utter weakness, helplessness, and dependence, were
carried off to bed, gazing distrustfully at her still with big blue
eyes; creatures whom any moderately strong hand could have
crushed like flies, but whose little minds not all the power on
earth could command or move. Strange contrast! Anne cried
when they were carried off to bed. Sir Robert had escaped
from the hot room, which stifled him, long before; and Sophy,
half angry in spite of herself, had made up her mind to “take
no notice of the little wretches.”</p>

<p>“Fancy!” she said; “shrinking at Anne—Anne, of all
people in the world! There is not a little puppy or kitten but
knows better. Little disagreeable things! Oh, love them!
Why should I love them? They are John's children, I believe;
but they are not a bit like him; they must be like their mother.
I don't see, for my part, what there is in them to love.”</p>

<p>“Oh, much, Sophy,” said Anne, drying her eyes; “they are
our own flesh and blood.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. They are certainly Mrs. John's flesh and
blood; at least, they are not a bit like us, and I cannot love
them for being like her, can I?—whom I never saw?”</p>

<p>The illogicality of this curious argument did not strike Anne.</p>

<p>“I hope they will get to like us,” she said. “Poor little
darlings! everything strange about them, new faces and places.
I don't wonder that they are frightened, and cry when any one
comes near them. We must trust to time. If they only knew
how I want to love them, to pet them—”</p>

<p>“I am going to help little Ursula with her packing,” said
Sophy hastily; and she hurried to Ursula's room, where all was
in disorder, and threw herself down in a chair by the fire,
“Anne is too good to live,” she cried. “She makes me angry
with her goodness. Little white-faced things like nobody I
know of, certainly not like our family, shrinking away and
clinging to that black woman as if Anne was an ogre—<i>Anne!</i>
why, a little dog knows better—as I said before.”</p>

<p>“I don't think they are very pretty children,” said Ursula,
not knowing how to reply.</p>

<p>“Why should we be supposed to be fond of them?” said
Sophy, who was relieving her own mind, not expecting any
help from Ursula. “The whole question of children is one
that puzzles me; a little helpless wax image that does not
know you, that can't respond to you, and won't perhaps when
it can; that has nothing interesting in it, that is not amusing
like a kitten, or even pretty. Well! let us suppose the people
it belongs to like it by instinct—but the rest of the world—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cousin Sophy!” cried Ursula, her eyes round with
alarm and horror.</p>

<p>“You think I ought to be fond of them because they are
my brother's children? We are not always very fond even of
our brothers, Ursula. Don't scream; at your age it is different;
but when they marry and have separate interests—if these
mites go on looking at me with those big scared eyes as if they
expected me to box their ears, I shall do it some day—I know
I shall; instead of going on my knees to them, like Anne, to
curry favour. If they had been like our family, why, that
would have been some attraction. Are you pleased to go home,
or would you prefer to stay here?”</p>

<p>“In London?” said Ursula, with a long-drawn breath, her
hands involuntarily clasping each other. “Oh! I hope you
won't think me very silly, but I do like London. Yes, I am
pleased—I have so many presents to take to them, thanks to
you and to Cousin Anne, and to Mrs. Copperhead. I am
ashamed to be carrying away so much. But Carlingford is not
like London,” she added, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“No, it is a pretty soft friendly country place, not a great
cold-hearted wilderness.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cousin Sophy!”</p>

<p>“My poor little innocent girl! Don't you think it is desolate
and cold-hearted, this great sea of people who none of them
care one straw for you?”</p>

<p>“I have seen nothing but kindness,” said Ursula, with a
little heat of virtuous indignation; “there is you, and Mrs.
Copperhead; and even the gentlemen were kind—or at least
they meant to be kind.”</p>

<p>“The gentlemen?” said Sophy, amused. “Do you mean the
Copperheads? Clarence perhaps? He is coming to Easton,
Ursula. Shall I bring him into Carlingford to see you?”</p>

<p>“If you please, Cousin Sophy,” said the girl, simply. She
had not been thinking any thoughts of “the gentlemen” which
could make her blush, but somehow her cousin's tone jarred
upon her, and she turned round to her packing. The room was
littered with the things which she was putting into her box,
that box which had grown a great deal too small now, though
it was quite roomy enough when Ursula left home.</p>

<p>“Ursula, I think you are a good little thing on the whole—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cousin Sophy, forgive me! No, I am not good.”</p>

<p>“Forgive you! for what? Yes, you are on the whole a good
little thing; not a saint, like Anne; but then you have perhaps
more to try your temper. We were always very obedient
to her, though we worried her, and papa always believed in her
with all his heart. Perhaps you have more to put up with.
But, my dear, think of poor Mrs. Copperhead, for example—”</p>

<p>“Why do you always call her poor Mrs. Copperhead? she
is very rich. She can make other people happy when she
pleases. She has a beautiful house, and everything—”</p>

<p>“And a bear, a brute of a husband.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Does she mind very much?” asked Ursula, with
composure. This drawback seemed to her insignificant, in
comparison with Mrs. Copperhead's greatness. It was only
Sophy's laugh that brought her to herself. She said with some
haste, putting in her dresses, with her back turned, “I do not
mean to say anything silly. When people are as old as she is,
do they mind? It cannot matter so much what happens when
you are old.”</p>

<p>“Why? but never mind, the theory is as good as many
others,” said Sophy. “You would not mind then marrying a
man like that, to have everything that your heart could
desire?”</p>

<p>“Cousin Sophy, I am not going to—marry any one,” said
Ursula, loftily, carrying her head erect. “I hope I am not
like that, thinking of such things. I am very, very sorry that
you should have such an opinion of me, after living together
ten days.”</p>

<p>She turned away with all the forlorn pride of injury, and
there were tears in her voice. Sophy, who dared not laugh in
reply, to make the young heroine more angry, hastened to
apologize.</p>

<p>“It was a silly question,” she said. “I have a very good
opinion of you, Ursula. Ten days is a long time, and I know
you as if we had been together all your life. I am sure you
do not think anything a nice girl ought not to think; but I
hope you will never be deceived and persuaded to marry any
one who is like Mr. Copperhead. I mean who is not nice
and young, and good, like yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” cried the girl, with energy. “But most likely I
shall not marry any one,” she added, with a half sigh; “Janey
may, but the eldest has so much to do, and so much to think
of. Cousin Anne has never married.”</p>

<p>“Nor Cousin Sophy either.” Sophy's laugh sounded hard to
the girl. “Never mind, you will not be like us. You will
marry, most likely, a clergyman, in a pretty parsonage in the
country.”</p>

<p>“I do not think I am very fond of clergymen,” said Ursula,
recovering her ease and composure. “They are always in and
about, and everything has to be kept so quiet when they are
studying; and then the parish people are always coming
tramping upstairs with their dirty feet. When you have only
one servant it is very, very troublesome. Sir Robert never
gives any trouble,” she said, once more, with a soft little sigh.</p>

<p>“Papa?” said Sophy, somewhat surprised; “but you would
not—” she was going to say, marry papa; but when she looked
at Ursula's innocent gravity, her absolute unconsciousness of
the meanings which her chance words might bear, she refrained.
“I think I must send Seton to help you,” she said, “you can
not get through all that packing by yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I am not tired. I have put in all my old things.
The rest are your presents. Oh, Cousin Sophy!” said the
girl, coming quickly to her and stealing two arms round her,
“you have been so good to me! as if it was not enough to give
me this holiday, the most delightful I ever had in my life—to
send me home loaded with all these beautiful things! I shall
never forget it, never, never, if I were to live a hundred years!”</p>

<p>“My dear!” cried Sophy, startled by the sudden energy of
this embrace. Sophy was not emotional, but her eyes moistened
and her voice softened in spite of herself. “But you
must let me send Seton to you,” she said, hurrying away. She
was excited by the day's events, and did not trust herself to
make any further response; for if she “gave way” at all, who
could tell how far the giving way might go? Her brother
John had been married at the time when Sophy too ought to
have been married, had all gone well—and, perhaps, some keen-piercing
thought that she too might have had little children
belonging to her, had given force and sharpness to her objections
to the pale little distrustful Indian children who had
shrunk from her overtures of affection. She went to her room
and bathed her eyes, which were hot and painful, and then she
went back to Anne in the sitting-room, who had opened the
window to reduce the temperature, and was resting in an easy
chair, and pondering what she could do to make the children
love her, and to be a mother to them in the absence of Mrs. John.</p>

<p>“I have been talking to Ursula, who is always refreshing,”
said Sophy. “I wonder whom that child will marry. She
gave me to understand, in her awkward, innocent way, that she
preferred papa. A laugh does one good,” Sophy added, slightly
rubbing her eyes. Anne made no immediate answer. She
scarcely heard indeed what her sister said.</p>

<p>“I think we shall get on after a while,” she said, softly.
“They said their prayers very prettily, poor darlings, and let
me kiss them without crying. After a while we shall get on, I
don't fear.”</p>

<p>“Anne!” cried Sophy, “you are too much for mere human
nature: you are too bad or too good for anything. I begin to
hate these little wretches when I hear you speak of them so.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Anne, “I know you don't mean it. Easton
will be very strange to them at first. I could not go to India
for my part. A crust of bread at home would be better.
Think of parting with your children just when they come to an
age to understand?”</p>

<p>“John, I suppose, did not take children into consideration
when he went away. You speak as if children were all one's
life.”</p>

<p>“A great part of it,” said Anne, gently. “No, dear, I am
not clever like you, and perhaps it is what you will call a low
view; but after all it runs through everything. The flowers
are used for the seed, and everything in the world is intended
to keep the world going. Yes, even I, that is the good of me.
I shall never be a mother, but what does that matter? There
are so many children left on the world whom somebody must
bring up.”</p>

<p>“And who are brought to you when they need you, and
taken from you when they need you no longer,” said Sophy,
indignantly; “you are left to bear the trouble—others have the
recompense.”</p>

<p>“It is so in this world, my dear, all the way down, from God
himself. Always looking for reward is mean and mercenary.
When we do nothing, when we are of no use, what a poor thing
life is,” said Anne, with a little colour rising in her cheeks,
“not worth having. I think we have only a right to our existence
when we are doing something. And I have my wages;
I like to be of a little consequence,” she said, laughing. “Nobody
is of any consequence who does not do something.”</p>

<p>“In that case, the ayah, the housemaid is of more consequence
than you.”</p>

<p>“So be it—I don't object,” said Anne; “but I don't think
so, for they have to be directed and guided. To be without a
housemaid is dreadful. The moment you think of that, you
see how important the people who work are; everything comes
to a stand-still without Mary, whereas there are ladies whose
absence would make no difference.”</p>

<p>“I, for instance.”</p>

<p>“You are very unkind to say so, Sophy; all the same, if you
were to do more, you would be happier, my dear.”</p>

<p>“To do what? go on my knees to those wax dolls, and entreat
them to let me pet them and make idols of them—as you
will do?”</p>

<p>“Well, how are you getting on now?” said Sir Robert,
coming in. “Ah! I see, you have the window open; but the
room is still very warm. When they get to Easton they will
have their own rooms of course. I don't want to reflect upon
John, but it is rather a burden this he has saddled us with.
Mrs. John's mother is living, isn't she? I think something
might have been <i>said</i> at least, on her part, some offer to take
her share.”</p>

<p>Sophy gave her sister a malicious glance, but promptly
changed her tone, and took up her position in defence of the
arrangement, with that ease which is natural in a family question.</p>

<p>“Of course,” she said, “your grandchildren, Dorsets, and
the heir, probably, as Robert has no boy, could go nowhere,
papa, but to us. It may be a bore, but at least John showed
so much sense; for nothing else could be——”</p>

<p>“John does not show very much sense in an ordinary way.
What did he want with a wife and children at his age? The
boy is five, isn't he? and the father only thirty—absurd! I
did not marry till I was thirty, though I had succeeded before
that time, and was the only son and the head of the family.
John was always an ass,” said Sir Robert, with a crossness
which sprang chiefly from the fact that the temperature of the
room was higher than usual, and the habits of his evening
interfered with. He was capable of sacrificing something of
much more importance to his family, but scarcely of sacrificing
his comfort, which is the last and most painful of efforts.</p>

<p>“That may be very true,” said Sophy, “but all the same, it
is only right that the children should be with us. Mrs. John's
people are not well off. Her mother has a large family of her
own. The little things would have been spoiled, or they would
have been neglected; and after all, they are Dorsets, though
they are not like John.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, I suppose you are right,” said Sir Robert,
grumbling, “and, thank Heaven, to-morrow we shall be at
home.”</p>

<p>Anne had scarcely said a word, though it was she who was
most deeply concerned about the children. She gave her
sister a hug when Sir Robert relapsed into the evening paper,
and then stole upstairs to look at the poor babies as they lay
asleep. She was not a mother, and never would be. People,
indeed, called her an old maid, and with reason enough, though
she was little over thirty; for had she been seventy, she could
not have been more unlikely to marry. It was not her vocation.
She had plenty to do in the world without that, and was
satisfied with her life. The sad reflection that the children
whom she tended were not her own, did not visit her mind, as,
perhaps, it had visited Sophy's, making her angry through the
very yearning of nature. Anne was of a different temperament,
she said a little prayer softly in her heart for the children
and for her sister as she stooped over the small beds. “God
bless the children—and, oh, make my Sophy happy!” she said.
She had never asked for nor thought of happiness to herself.
It had come to her unconsciously, in her occupations, in her
duties, as natural as the soft daylight, and as little sought after.
But Sophy was different. Sophy wanted material for happiness—something
to make her glad; she did not possess it, like
her sister, in the quiet of her own heart. And from the children's
room Anne went to Ursula's, where the girl, tired with
her packing, was brushing her pretty hair out before she went
to bed. Everything was ready, the drawers all empty, the box
full to overflowing, and supplemented by a large parcel in
brown paper; and what with the fatigue and the tumult of
feeling in her simple soul, Ursula was ready to cry when her
cousin came in and sat down beside her.</p>

<p>“I have been so happy, Cousin Anne. You have been so
good to me,” she said.</p>

<p>“My dear, everybody will be good to you,” said Miss Dorset,
“so long as you trust everybody, Ursula. People are more
good than bad. I hope when you come to Easton you will be
still happier.”</p>

<p>Ursula demurred a little to this, though she was too shy to
say much. “Town is so cheerful,” she said. It was not Sir
Robert's way of looking at affairs.</p>

<p>“There is very little difference in places,” said Anne, “when
your heart is light you are happy everywhere.” Ursula felt
that it was somewhat derogatory to her dignity to have her
enjoyment set down to the score of a light heart. But against
such an assertion what could she say?</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_IX"/>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>COMING HOME.</h3>


<p>The party which set out from Suffolk Street next morning
was a mighty one; there were the children, the ayah, the new
nurse whom Anne had engaged in town, to take charge of her
little nephews as soon as they got accustomed to their new life;
and Seton, the ancient serving-woman, whom the sisters shared
between them; and Sir Robert's man, not to speak of Sir
Robert himself and the Miss Dorsets and Ursula. Easton was
within a dozen miles of Carlingford, so that they all travelled
together as far as that town. The Dorset party went farther on
to the next station, from which they had still six miles to travel
by carriage. They set down Ursula on the platform with her
box and her parcel, and took leave of her, and swept out of the
station again, leaving her rather forlorn and solitary among the
crowd. “Disgraceful of May not to send some one to meet the
child. I suppose he knew she was coming,” said Sir Robert.
And Ursula had something of the same feeling, as she stood
looking wistfully about her. But as soon as the train was gone,
her name was called in a somewhat high-pitched voice, and
turning round she found herself hugged by Janey, while
Johnnie, fresh from school, seized her bag out of her hand by
way of showing his satisfaction.</p>

<p>“We didn't come up till we could make sure that the
Dorsets were out of the way,” said Janey, “and, oh, is it really
you? I am so glad to get you home.”</p>

<p>“Why didn't you want to see the Dorsets? They are the
kindest friends we have in the world,” said Ursula. “How is
papa? Is he in a good humour? And the rest? Why did
not some more come to meet me? I made sure there would
be four at least.”</p>

<p>“Amy and Robin have gone out to tea—they didn't want to
go; but papa insisted. Oh, he is very well on the whole. And
Reginald is at home, of course, but I thought you would like
me best. Johnnie came to carry the bag,” said Janey with a
natural contempt for her younger brother. “What a big
parcel! You must have been getting quantities of presents,
or else you must have packed very badly, for I am sure there
was lots of room in the trunk when you went away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Janey, if you only knew what I have got there!”</p>

<p>“What?” said Janey, with quiet but composed interest.
It never occurred to her that she could have any individual
concern in the contents of the parcels. She was a tall girl who
had outgrown all her frocks, or rather did outgrow them
periodically, with dark elf locks about her shoulders, which
would not curl or <i>crêper</i>, or do anything that hair ought to do.
She had her thoughts always in the clouds, forming all sorts
of impossible plans, as was natural to her age, and was just the
kind of angular, jerky school-girl, very well intentioned, but
very maladroit, who is a greater nuisance to herself and everybody
else than even a school-boy, which is saying a good deal.
Things broke in her hands as they never broke in anybody
else's; stuffs tore, furniture fell to the ground as she passed
by. Ursula carefully kept her off the parcel and gave it to
Johnnie. One of the railway porters, when all the rest of the
passengers were disposed of, condescended to carry her trunk,
and thus they set out on their way home. The parsonage was
close to St. Roque, at the other end of Grange Lane. They
had to walk all the way down that genteel and quiet suburban
road, by the garden walls over which, at this season, no scent
of flowers came, or blossomed branches hung forth. There
were red holly-berries visible, and upon one mossy old tree a
gray bunch of mistletoe could be seen on the other side of the
street. But how quiet it was! They scarcely met a dozen
people between the station and St. Roque.</p>

<p>“Oh, Janey, is everybody dead?” said Ursula. “How dull
it is! You should see London——”</p>

<p>“Ursula,” said Janey firmly, “once for all, I am not going
to stand this London! A nasty, smoky, muddy place, no more
like Carlingford than—I am like you. You forget I have been
in London; you are not speaking to ignorant ears,” said
Janey, drawing herself up, “and your letters were quite bad
enough. You are not going to talk of nothing but your disagreeable
London here. Talk to people who have never seen
it!” said the girl, elevating her shoulders with the contempt
of knowledge.</p>

<p>“That time you were at the dentist's—” said Ursula, “and
call that seeing London! Cousin Anne and Cousin Sophy took
me everywhere. We went to drive in the Park. We went to
the Museum and the National Gallery. And, oh! Janey,
listen! we went to the theatre: think of that!”</p>

<p>“Well, I should like to go to the theatre,” said Janey, with a
sigh. “But you told me in your letter. That's what comes
of being the eldest. Unless you get married, or something,
nobody will ever think of taking <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“You are five years younger than I am,” said Ursula, with
dignity. “Naturally, people don't think of a girl at your age.
You must wait till you are older, as I have had to do. Janey!
guess what is in <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“Your new dress—your ball-dress. If it isn't crumpled as
you said, you can't have danced very much. I know my dress
will be in tatters if I ever go to a ball.”</p>

<p>“I danced as much as I wished. I did not know many
people,” said Ursula, drawing herself up. “Of course at this
time of the year nobody is in town, and we hardly knew any one—and
of course—”</p>

<p>“Of course, you only knew the fashionable people who are
out of town in winter,” cried Janey, with a laugh which echoed
along the street. Ursula had not come home from London to
be laughed at by her younger sister, she who had been petted
by the Dorsets, and whose opinion even Sir Robert had asked
on various occasions. She felt this downfall all the more deeply
that she had been looking forward to so many long talks with
Janey, and expected to live all her brief ten days' holiday over
again, and to instruct her young sister's mind by the many experiences
acquired in that momentous time. Poor Ursula! ten
days is quite long enough to form habits at her age, and she
had been taken care of, as young ladies are taken care of in
society; accompanied or attended wherever she went, and
made much of. To find herself thus left to arrive and get
home as she pleased, with nobody but Janey to meet her, was
a terrible falling-off; and to be laughed at by Janey was the
last step of all. Tears filled her eyes, she turned her shoulder
to her companion, averting her head; and this was all poor
Ursula had to look to. The dreary Carlingford street, papa
finding fault, everything going wrong, and Janey laughing at
her! To be Cousin Anne's maid, or governess to the little
Indian children would be better than this. For five minutes
more she walked on in offended silence, saying nothing, though
Janey, like the school-girl she was, made frequent use of her
elbow to move her sister.</p>

<p>“Ursula!” the girl said at last, with a more potent nudge,
“what's the matter? won't you speak to me?” And Janey,
who had her own disappointment too, and had expected to be
received with enthusiasm, burst out crying, regardless of appearances,
in the middle of the street.</p>

<p>“Janey, for Heaven's sake—people will see you! I am sure
it is I who should cry, not you,” said Ursula, in sudden distress.</p>

<p>“I don't care who sees me,” sobbed Janey. “You have been
enjoying yourself while we have stayed at home, and instead of
being pleased to come back, or glad to see us—Oh, how can
you be so cold-hearted?” she said with a fresh burst of tears.</p>

<p>Here the other side of the question suddenly dawned upon
Ursula. She had been enjoying herself while the others
stayed at home. It was quite true. Instead of feeling the shock
of difference she should have thought of those who had never
been so lucky as she was, who had never seen anything out of
Carlingford. “Don't be so foolish, Janey,” she said, “I <i>am</i>
glad;—and I have brought you such beautiful presents. But
when you do nothing but laugh——”</p>

<p>“I am sure I didn't laugh to hurt. I only laughed for fun!”
cried Janey, drying her eyes not without a little indignation;
and thus peace was made, for indeed one was dying to tell all
that happened, and the other dying to hear. They walked
the rest of the way with their heads very close together, so absorbed
that the eldest brother, coming out of the gate as they
approached, stood looking at them with a smile on his face for
some time before they saw him. A slight young man, not very
tall, with dark hair, like Ursula's, and a somewhat anxious expression,
in correct English clerical dress.</p>

<p>“Has it all begun already?” he said, when they came close
up to him, but without perceiving him, Ursula's face inspired
with the pleasure of talking, as Janey's was with the eager delight
of listening. The house was built in the ecclesiastical
style, with gables and mullioned windows, which excluded the
light, at least, whether or not they inspired passers-by with a
sense of correct art, as they were intended to do. It was next
door to the church, and had a narrow strip of shrubbery in
front, planted with somewhat gloomy evergreens. The gate
and door stood always open, except when Mr. May himself,
coming or going, closed them momentarily, and it cannot be
denied that there were outward and visible signs of a large,
somewhat unruly family inside.</p>

<p>“Oh, Reginald!” cried Ursula. “You have come home!”</p>

<p>“Yes—for good,” he said with a half-laugh, half-sigh. “Or
for bad—who can tell? At all events, here I am.”</p>

<p>“Why should it be for bad?” cried Janey, whose voice was
always audible half-way up the street. “Oh, Ursula, something
very nice has happened. He is to be warden of the old
college, fancy! That <i>is</i> being provided for, papa says; and a
beautiful old house.”</p>

<p>“Warden of the old college! I thought it was always some
old person who was chosen.”</p>

<p>“But papa says he can live at home and let the house,” cried
Janey. “There is no reason why it should be an old gentleman,
papa thinks; it is nice, because there is no work—but
look at Reginald, he does not like it a bit; he is never satisfied,
I am sure, I wish it was me—”</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Reginald hastily, “I don't want all my
affairs, and my character besides, to be proclaimed from the
house-tops.” Janey stopped indignant, to make some reply,
and Ursula, grasping her arm, as she feared, with an energetic
pinch, went in quickly. Little Amy had been playing in the
little square hall, which was strewed with doll's clothes, and
with two or three dolls in various stages of dilapidation. Some
old, ragged school-books lay in a corner, the leaves out of one
of which were blowing about in the wind. Even ten days of
Anne Dorset's orderly reign had opened Ursula's eyes to these
imperfections.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a muddle!” she cried; “I don't wonder that
Reginald does not care for living at home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish papa heard you!” cried Janey loudly, as Ursula
led the way into the drawing-room, which was not much
tidier than the hall. There was a basket-full of stockings to
be mended, standing on the old work-table. Ursula felt, with
a sinking of the heart, that they were waiting for her arrival,
and that Janey had done nothing to them. More toys and
more old school-books were tossed about upon the faded old
carpet. The table-cover hung uneven, one end of it dragging
upon the floor. The fire was burning very low, stifled in dust
and white ashes. How dismal it looked! not like a place to
come home to. “Oh, I don't wonder Reginald is vexed to be
made to live at home,” she said once again to herself, with tears
in her eyes.</p>

<p>“I hope you have enjoyed yourself,” her brother said, as she
dropped wearily into the old easy-chair. “We have missed you
very much; but I don't suppose you missed us. London was
very pleasant, I suppose, even at this time of the year?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pleasant!” said Ursula. “If you had been with me,
how you would have liked it! Suffolk Street is only an inn,
but it is a very nice inn, what they call a private hotel. Far
better than the great big places on the American principle, Sir
Robert says. But we dined at one of those big places one
day, and it was very amusing. Scores of people, and great
mirrors that made them look hundreds. And such quantities
of lights and servants; but Sir Robert thought Suffolk Street
very much the best. And I went to two theatres and to a ball.
They were so kind. Sophy Dorset laughs at me sometimes,
but Anne is an angel,” said Ursula fervently. “I never knew
any one so good in my life.”</p>

<p>“That is not saying much,” said Janey, “for none of us are
very good, and you know nobody else. Anne Dorset is an old
maid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Janey! how dare you?”</p>

<p>“And, for that matter, so is Sophy. Papa says so. He says
she was jilted, and that she will never get a husband.”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue,” said Reginald fiercely, “if we are to
hear what my father says at second hand through an imp like
you—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Janey, mocking, “that is because you are
not friends with papa.”</p>

<p>“Janey, come and help me to take off my things,” said
Ursula, seeing that Reginald would probably proceed to strong
measures and box his sister's ears. “If you were older, you
would not talk like that,” she said, with dignity, as they went
upstairs. “Oh, dear Janey, you can't think how different
Cousin Anne and Sophy are, who are not girls, like us. They
never talk unkindly of other people. You would get to think
it childish, as I do, if you had been living with Cousin
Anne.”</p>

<p>“Stuff!” said Janey. “Papa is not childish, I hope. And
it was he who said all that. I don't care what your fine
Cousin Anne does.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, the reproof thus administered went to
Janey's heart; for to a girl of fifteen, whose next sister is
almost twenty, the reproach of being childish is worse than any
other. She blushed fiery-red, and though she scoffed, was
moved. Besides, though it suited her to quote him for the
moment, she was very far from putting any unbounded faith in
papa.</p>

<p>“Just wait a moment! See what Cousin Anne, whom you
think so little of, has sent you,” said Ursula, sitting down on
the floor with the great parcel in her lap, carefully undoing the
knots; for she had read Miss Edgeworth's stories in her youth,
and would not have cut the strings for the world; and when
the new dresses, in all their gloss and softness, were spread out
upon the old carpet, which scarcely retained one trace of colour,
Janey was struck dumb.</p>

<p>“Is that,” she said, faltering and conscience-stricken, “for
<i>me</i>?”</p>

<p>“This is for you; though you think them old maids—and
that they will never get husbands,” said Ursula, indignantly.
“What a thing for a girl to say! And, indeed, I don't think
Cousin Anne will ever get a husband. There is not one in the
world half good enough for her—not one! Yes, this is for you.
They went themselves, and looked over half the things in the
shop before they could get one to please them. They did not
say, 'Janey is an unkind little thing, that will repeat all she
hears about us, and does not care for us a bit.' They said,
'Ursula, we must choose frocks for Janey and Amy. Come
and help us to get what they will like best.'”</p>

<p>Janey's lips quivered, and two very big tears came into her
eyes. She was stricken with the deepest compunction, but her
pride did not permit her to give in all at once.</p>

<p>“I dare say you told her how badly off we were,” she said.</p>

<p>“I told her nothing about it, and she did not say a word—not
a word, as if it were a charity—only to please you—to let
you see that you were remembered; but I dare say it is quite
true after all,” said Ursula, with lofty irony, “that Cousin
Anne will never get a husband, and that they are old maids.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you know I didn't mean it!” said Janey, giving way
to her tears.</p>

<p>Then Ursula got up and took off her hat and smoothed her
hair, feeling satisfied with her success, and went downstairs
again to Reginald, who was seated on the dingy sofa waiting
for her, to answer her questions about the great event which
had happened since she had been away. Ursula's mind was
full of the shock of the sharp impression made by her return,
though the impression itself began to wear away.</p>

<p>“I can understand why you don't care about living at
home,” she said. “Oh I wonder if I could do anything to
mend it! I am so glad you have got something, Reginald.
If you have a good servant, you might be quite comfortable
by yourself, and we could come and see you. I should not feel
it a bit—not a single bit; and it would be so much nicer
for you.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” said her brother. “It is not staying
at home I object to. We are not very tidy or very comfortable,
perhaps, but we all belong to each other, at least. It is not
that, Ursula.”</p>

<p>“What is it, then? Janey says,” said Ursula, drawing a
long breath of awe and admiration, “that you are to have two
hundred and fifty pounds a year.”</p>

<p>“For doing nothing,” he said.</p>

<p>“For doing nothing?” She looked up at him a little
bewildered, for his tone struck Ursula as not at all corresponding
with the delightful character of the words he said. “But,
Reginald, how nice, how very nice it sounds! How lucky you
must have been! How could it happen that such a delightful
thing should come to one of us? We are always so unlucky,
papa says.”</p>

<p>“If you think this luck—” said Reginald. “He does, and
he is quite pleased; but how do you suppose I can be pleased?
Thrust into a place where I am not wanted—where I can be
of no use. A dummy, a practical falsehood. How can I
accept it, Ursula? I tell you it is a sinecure!”</p>

<p>Ursula looked at him with eyes round with wonder. He
seemed to be speaking in some different language of which she
understood nothing. “What is a sinecure?” she said.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_X"/>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>PAPA.</h3>


<p>“Ursula has come back!” cried the little ones, who had
returned from their tea-party, running to meet their father at
the door.</p>

<p>Mr. May was very good, except by moments, to his younger
children. He was not, indeed, an unkind father to any of
them; but he had never forgiven Providence for leaving him
with his motherless family upon his hands, a man so utterly
unfit for the task. Perhaps he did not put this exactly into
words, but he felt it deeply, and had never got over it. There
were so many things that he could have done better, and there
were so many people who could have done this better; and
yet it was precisely to him, not a person adapted to the charge
of children, that it had been given to do it! This seemed to
argue a want of judgment in the regulation of mortal affairs,
which irritated him all the more because he was a clergyman,
and had to persuade other people that everything that happened
to them was for the best. He was a man of some culture, and
literary power, and wrote very pleasant “thoughtful” papers
for some of the Church magazines; but these compositions,
though very easy to read, were only brought into the world by
elaborate precautions on the part of the family, which scarcely
dared to speak above its breath when papa was “writing;” for
on such occasions he could be very savage, as the occasional
offender knew. He was a man with an imposing person, good-looking,
and of very bland and delightful manners, when he
chose. But yet he had never made friends, and was now at
fifty-five the incumbent of St. Roque, with a small income and
a humble position in the church hierarchy of Carlingford.
He preached better than any other of the Carlingford clergymen,
looked better, had more reputation out of the place;
and was of sufficiently good family, and tolerably well connected.
Yet he never got on, never made any real advance in
life. Nobody could tell what was the cause of this, for his
opinions were moderate and did not stand in his way—indeed
within the limits of moderation he had been known to modify
his principles, now inclining towards the high, then towards
the low, according as circumstances required, though never going
too far in either direction. Such a man ought to have been
successful, according to all rules, but he was not. He was
generally in debt and always needy. His eldest son, James,
was in India, doing well, and had often sent a contribution
towards the comfort of the family, and especially to help Reginald
at College. But James had married a year before, and
accordingly was in a less favourable position for sending help.
And indeed these windfalls had never produced much effect
upon the family, who heard of James' gifts vaguely without
profiting by them. All this <i>donna à penser</i> to the elder children.
Having no softening medium of a mother's eyes to look at
their father through, they were more bold in judging him than,
perhaps, they ought to have been; and he did not take pains
to fascinate his children, or throw the glamour of love into
their eyes. He took it for granted, frankly and as a part of
nature, that he himself was the first person to be considered
in all matters. So he was, of course—so the father, the bread-winner,
the head of the family, ought to be; and when he has
a wife to keep him upon that pedestal, and to secure that his
worship shall be respected, it becomes natural, and the first
article of the family creed; but somehow when a man has to
set forth and uphold this principle himself, it is less successful;
and in Mr. May's case it was not successful at all. He was
not severe or tyrannical, so that they might have rebelled. He
only held the conviction quite honestly and ingeniously, that
his affairs came first, and were always to be attended to. Nothing
could be said against this principle—but it tells badly in
the management of a family unless, indeed, as we have said, it
is managed through the medium of the mother, who takes away
all imputation of selfishness by throwing an awful importance
and tender sanctity over all that happens to be desirable or
necessary for “papa.”</p>

<p>Mr. May had no wife to watch over the approaches of his
study, and talk of him with reverential importance to her
children. This was not his fault, but his misfortune. Bitterly
had he mourned and resented the blow which took her from
him, and deeply felt the loss she was to him. This was how
he spoke of it always, the loss to him; and probably poor Mrs.
May, who had adored and admired her husband to the last day
of her life, would have been more satisfied with this way of
mourning for her than any other; but naturally Ursula, who
thought of the loss to herself and the other children, found
fault with this limitation of the misfortune. A man who has
thus to fight for himself does not appear in an amiable aspect
to his family, to whom, as to all young creatures, it seemed
natural that <i>they</i> should be the first objects; and as they were
a great trouble and burden to him, perhaps the children did not
always bear their most amiable aspect to their father. Both
looked selfish to the other, and Mr. May, no doubt, could have
made out quite as good a case as the children did. He thought
all young people were selfish, taking everything they could, trying
to extract even the impossible from the empty purse and
strained patience of their elders; and they thought that he
was indifferent to them, thinking about himself, as it is a
capital sin in a parent to do; and both of them were right and
both wrong, as indeed may be said in every case to which there
are two sides.</p>

<p>“Ursula has come!” cried the two little ones. Amy and
Robin could read their father's face better than they could read
those instruments of torture called printed books, and they saw
that he was in a good humour, and that they were safe to venture
upon the playful liberty of seizing him, one by each hand,
and dragging him in. He was a tall man, and the sight of
him triumphantly dragged in by these imps, the youngest of
whom was about up to his knees, was pretty, and would have
gone to the heart of any spectator. He was not himself unconscious
of this, and when he was in a good humour, and the
children were neat and tolerably dressed, he did not object to
being seen by the passers-by dragged up his own steps by those
two little ones. The only passers-by, however, on this occasion
were a retired shopkeeper and his wife, who had lately
bought one of the oldest houses in Grange Lane, and who had
come out for a walk as the day was fine. “Mark my words,
Tozer,” the lady was saying, “that's a good man though he's
a church parson. Them as children hangs onto like that, ain't
got no harm in them.”</p>

<p>“He's a rum un, he is,” said Mr. Tozer in reply. It was
a pity that the pretty spectacle of the clergyman with his
little boy and girl should have been thus thrown away upon a
couple of Dissenters, yet it was not without its effect. Amy
pulled one arm and Robin pulled the other. They were dark-haired
children like all the Mays, and as this peculiarity is
rare among children, it gave these two a certain piquancy.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he said, “take me to Ursula,” and after he had
kissed his newly-arrived daughter, he sat down in the faded drawing-room
with much geniality, and took one child on each knee.</p>

<p>“I hope you have enjoyed yourself, Ursula,” he said; “of
course, we have missed you. Janey has done her best, but she
is not very clever at housekeeping, nor does she understand
many things that people require, as you have learned to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad you have missed me!” said Ursula, “I
mean sorry; I have enjoyed myself very, very much. The
Dorsets were so kind, kinder than anybody ever was before.”</p>

<p>“And, papa, they have sent me a new dress.”</p>

<p>“And me too, papa,” chirruped little Amy on his knee.</p>

<p>“You too, Mouse! it was very kind of them; and you went to
the Tower and did all the lions, Ursula? that is the lot of country
cousins, and the Dorsets would spare you nothing, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“We went to much better things,” said Ursula, producing
her theatres and her ball as she had done before. “And, oh,
papa, I like them so much. I wish we lived a little nearer.
Those poor little Indian children, I fear they will be too much
for Cousin Anne; they look so pale and so peevish, not like
our children here.”</p>

<p>“Well, they are not pale at all events,” said Mr. May, putting
them down; “run and play like good children. You will
have heard that we have had something happening to us, even in
this quiet place, while you were away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was so astonished,” said Ursula, “but Reginald
doesn't seem to like it. That is so odd; I should have thought
he would have been overjoyed to get something. He used to
talk so about having no interest.”</p>

<p>“Reginald is like a great many other people. He does not
know his own mind,” said Mr. May, his countenance overcasting.
Ursula knew that sign of coming storms well enough,
but she was too much interested to forbear.</p>

<p>“What is a sinecure, papa?” she asked, her brother's last
word still dwelling in her mind.</p>

<p>“A piece of outrageous folly,” he cried, getting up and
striding about the room, “all springing from the foolish books
boys read now-a-days, and the nonsense that is put into their
minds. Mean! it means that your brother is an ass, that is what
it means. After all the money that has been spent upon him—”</p>

<p>“But, papa, we have not spent much, have we? I thought
it was his scholarship?” said Ursula with injudicious honesty.
Her father turned upon her indignantly.</p>

<p>“I am not aware that I said we. <i>We</i> have nothing to spend
upon any one, so far as I know. I said I—the only person
in the house who earns any money or is likely to do so, if
Reginald goes on in this idiotical way.”</p>

<p>Ursula grew red. She was Mr. May's own daughter, and
had a temper too. “If I could earn any money I am sure I
would,” she cried, “and only too glad. I am sure it is wanted
badly enough. But how is a girl to earn any money? I wish
I knew how.”</p>

<p>“You little fool, no one was thinking of you. Do a little
more in the house, and nobody will ask you to earn money.
Yes, this is the shape things are taking now-a-days,” said Mr.
May, “the girls are mad to earn anyhow, and the boys, forsooth,
have a hundred scruples. If women would hold their tongues
and attend to their own business, I have no doubt we should
have less of the other nonsense. The fact is everything is
getting into an unnatural state. But if Reginald thinks I am
going to maintain him in idleness at his age—”</p>

<p>“Papa, for Heaven's sake don't speak so loud, he will hear
you!” said Ursula, letting her fears of a domestic disturbance
overweigh her prudence.</p>

<p>“He will hear me? I wish him to hear me,” said Mr. May,
raising his voice. “Am I to be kept from saying what I like,
how I like, in my own house, for fear that Reginald should
hear me, forsooth! Ursula, I am glad to have you at home; but
if you take Reginald's part in his folly, and set yourself against
the head of the family, you had better go back again and at
once. <i>He</i> may defy me, but I shall not be contradicted by a
chit of a girl, I give you my word for that.”</p>

<p>Ursula was silent; she grew pale now after her redness of
hasty and unconsidered self-defence. Oh, for Cousin Anne to
shield and calm her; what a difference it made to plunge back
again thus into trouble and strife.</p>

<p>“He thinks it better to be idle at his father's expense than
to do a little work for a handsome salary,” said Mr. May;
“everything is right that is extracted from his father's pocket,
though it is contrary to a high code of honour to accept a
sinecure. Fine reasoning that, is it not? The one wrongs
nobody, while the other wrongs you and me and all the children,
who want every penny I have to spend; but Reginald is much
too fine to think of that. He thinks it quite natural that I
should go on toiling and stinting myself.”</p>

<p>“Papa, it may be very wrong what he is doing; but if you
think he wants to take anything from you—”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue,” said her father; “I believe in deeds,
not in words. He has it in his power to help me, and he
chooses instead, for a miserable fantastic notion of his own,
to balk all my care for him. Of course the hospital was offered
to him out of respect for me. No one cares for <i>him</i>. He is
about as much known in Carlingford as—little Amy is. Of
course it is to show their respect to me. And here he comes
with his fantastic nonsense about a sinecure! Who is he that
he should make such a fuss? Better men than he is have held
them, and will to the end of the chapter. A sinecure! what
does he call a sinecure?”</p>

<p>“That is just what I want to know,” said Ursula under her
breath, but her father did not, fortunately, hear this ejaculation.
Reginald had gone out, and happily was not within hearing,
and Mr. May calmed down by degrees, and told Ursula various
circumstances about the parish and the people which brought
him down out of his anger and comforted her after that passage
of arms. But the commotion left him in an excitable state, a
state in which he was very apt to say things that were disagreeable,
and to provoke his children to wrath in a way which
Ursula thought was very much against the scriptural rule.</p>

<p>“Things in the parish are going on much as usual,” he said,
“Mrs. Sam Hurst is as kind as ever.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Ursula with a suppressed snort of anger.
Mr. May gave the kind of offensive laugh, doubly offensive
to every woman, which men give when their vanity is excited,
and when there is, according to the common expression, a lady
in the case.</p>

<p>“Yes, she is very kind,” he said with a twinkle in his eye.
“She has had the children to tea a great many times since
you have been away. To show my sense of her kindness, you
must ask her one of these days. A woman who understands
children is always a valuable friend for a man in my position—and
also, Ursula, for a girl in yours.”</p>

<p>“She may understand children, but they are not fond of her,”
said Ursula, with a gleam of malice which restored her father
to good humour. He had no more idea of marrying a second
time than of flying. He was tenderly attached in his way to
his wife's memory, and quite sufficiently troubled by the number
of dwellers in his house already; but he rather liked, as a good-looking
man in his wane generally does, to think that he could
marry if he pleased, and to hold the possibility over the heads
of his household, as a chastisement of all their sins against him
which he could use at any time. All the Mays grew hot and
angry at the name of Mrs. Sam Hurst, and their fear and anger
delighted their father. He liked to speak of her to provoke
them, and partly for that, partly for other reasons of his own,
kept up a decorous semi-flirtation with his neighbour who lived
next door, and thus excited the apprehensions and resentment
of the girls every day of their lives. When Ursula thought of
Mrs. Sam Hurst she wished for the Dorsets no more. It was
above all things, she felt, her duty to be here on the spot to
defend the family from that woman's machinations. The idea
put energy into her. She ceased to be tired, ceased to feel herself,
“after her journey,” capable of nothing but sitting still and
hearing of all that had been done since she went away.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening, however, Ursula took advantage
of a quiet moment to look into the dictionary and make
herself quite safe about the meaning of the word sinecure. It
was not the first time she had heard it, as may be supposed.
She had heard of lucky people who held sinecures, and she
had heard them denounced as evil things, but without entering
closely into the meaning. Now she had a more direct interest
in it, and it must be confessed that she was not at all frightened
by the idea, or disposed to reject it as Reginald did. Ursula
had not learnt much about public virtue, and to get a good
income for doing nothing, or next to nothing, seemed to her an
ideal sort of way of getting one's livelihood. She wished with
a sigh that there were sinecures which could be held by girls.
But no, in that as in other things “gentlemen” kept all that
was good to themselves; and Ursula was disposed to treat
Reginald's scruples with a very high hand. But she did not
choose that her father should attack him with all these disagreeable
speeches about maintaining him in idleness, and taunts
about the money that had been spent on his education. That
was not the way to manage him, the girl felt; but Ursula
resolved to take her brother in hand herself, to argue with him
how foolish it was, to point out to him that if he did not take
it some one else would, and that the country would not gain
anything while he would lose, to laugh at his over delicacy, to
show him how delightful it would be if he was independent, and
what a help to all his brothers and sisters. In short, it seemed
quite simple to Ursula, and she felt her path mapped out before
her, and triumphed in every stage of her argument, inventing
the very weakest replies for Reginald to make. Full of the inspiration
of this purpose, she felt that it was in every way well
that she had come home. With Reginald settled close by,
going away no longer, standing by her in her difficulties, and
even perhaps, who could tell? taking her to parties, and affording
her the means now and then of asking two or three people
to tea, the whole horizon of her life brightened for Ursula. She
became reconciled to Carlingford. All that had to be done was
to show Reginald what his duty was, and how foolish he was
to hesitate, and she could not allow herself to suppose that <i>when
it was put before him properly</i> there could long remain much
difficulty upon that score.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XI"/>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>PHŒBE'S PREPARATIONS.</h3>


<p>A few days after Ursula's return home, another arrival took
place in Carlingford. Phœbe Beecham, after considering the
case fully, and listening with keen interest to all the indications
she could pick up as to the peculiarities of her grandfather's
house, and the many things in life at Carlingford which
were “unlike what she had been used to,” had fully made up
her mind to dare the difficulties of that unknown existence,
and to devote herself in her mother's place to the care of her
grandmother and the confusion of Mrs. Tom. This was partly
undertaken out of a sense of duty, partly out of that desire for
change and the unknown, which has to content itself in many
cases with the very mildest provision, and partly because
Phœbe's good sense perceived the necessity of the matter.
She was by no means sure what were the special circumstances
that made “Mrs. Tom” disagreeable to her mother, but she
was deeply sensible of the importance of preventing Mrs. Tom
from securing to herself and her family all that Mr. and Mrs.
Tozer had to leave. Phœbe was not mercenary in her own
person, but she had no idea of giving up any “rights,” and
she felt it of the utmost importance that her brother, who
was unfortunately by no means so clever as herself, should be
fully provided against all the contingencies of life. She was
not concerned about herself in that particular. Phœbe felt
it a matter of course that she should marry, and marry well.
Self-confidence of this assured and tranquil sort serves a great
many excellent purposes—it made her even generous in her
way. She believed in her star, in her own certain good-fortune,
in herself; and therefore her mind was free to think
and to work for other people. She knew very well by all her
mother said, and by all the hesitations of both her parents,
that she would have many disagreeable things to encounter in
Carlingford, but she felt so sure that nothing could really humiliate
<i>her</i>, or pull her down from her real eminence, that the
knowledge conveyed no fears to her mind. When this confidence
in her own superiority to all debasing influences is held
by the spotless princess in the poem, it is the most beautiful
of human sentiments, and why it should not be equally
elevated when entertained by a pink and plump modern young
woman, well up in all nineteenth century refinements, and the
daughter of the minister of the Crescent Chapel, it would be
hard to say. Phœbe held it with the strongest faith.</p>

<p>“Their ways of thinking, perhaps, and their ways of living,
are not those which I have been used to,” she said; “but how
does that affect me? I am myself whatever happens; even if poor
dear grandmamma's habits are not refined, which I suppose is
what you mean, mamma, that does not make me unrefined.
A lady must always be a lady wherever she is—Una,” she
continued, using strangely enough the same argument which
has occurred to her historian, “is not less a princess when she
is living among the satyrs. Of course, I am not like Una—and
neither are they like the wild people in the wood.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beecham did not know much about Una, except that
she was somebody in a book; but she kissed her daughter, and
assured her that she was “a real comfort,” and devoted herself to
her comfort for the few days that remained, doing everything that
it was possible to do to show her love, and, so to speak, gratitude
to the good child who was thus throwing herself into the breach.
The Beechams were in no want of money to buy what pleased
them, and the mother made many additions to Phœbe's wardrobe
which that young lady herself thought quite unnecessary, not
reflecting that other sentiments besides that of simple love for
herself were involved.</p>

<p>“They shall see that my daughter is not just like one of their
common-looking girls,” Mrs. Beecham said to her husband; and
he shared the feeling, though he could not but think within himself
that her aspect was of very much more importance than the
appearance of Phœbe Tozer's child could possibly be as <i>his</i>
daughter.</p>

<p>“You are quite right, my dear,” he replied, “vulgar people
of that sort are but too ready to look down upon a pastor's
family. They ought to be made to see the difference.”</p>

<p>The consequence of this was that Phœbe was fitted out like a
young princess going on her travels. Ursula May would have
been out of her wits with delight, had half these fine things
come her way; but Phœbe took them very calmly.</p>

<p>“I have never undervalued dress,” she said, “as some girls
do; I think it is a very important social influence. And even
without that, mamma, so long as it pleases you—” So with
this mixture of philosophy and affection all went well.</p>

<p>“We must call on Mrs. Copperhead before you go; they
would think it strange, after all the interest they have shown
in us.”</p>

<p>“Have they shown an interest in us?” said Phœbe. “Of
course we must call—and Mrs. Copperhead is a lady, but as for
Mr. Copperhead, mamma—”</p>

<p>“Hush! he is the leading member, and very influential in
the connection. A pastor's family must not be touchy, Phœbe.
We must put up with a great many things. There ought to
be peace among brethren, you know, and harmony is the first
thing that is essential in a church—”</p>

<p>“I wonder if harmony would be as essential, supposing Mr.
Copperhead to come to grief, mamma.”</p>

<p>“Phœbe! slang from you—who have always set your face
against it.”</p>

<p>“What can one talk but slang when one thinks of such a
person?” said Phœbe gravely; and thus saying she opened the
door for her mother, and they went out in their best gowns to
pay their visit. Mrs. Copperhead was very civil to the pastor's
family. It was not in her to be uncivil to any one; but in her
soft heart she despised them a little, and comported herself to
them with that special good behaviour and dignified restraint
which the best natured people reserve for their inferiors. For
though she went to chapel, taken there by Mr. Copperhead, she
was “church” at heart. The interest which Mrs. Beecham
took in everything, and the praises she bestowed on the ball,
did not relax her coldness. They were too well off, too warm
and silken to call forth her sympathies, and there was little in
common between them to afford any ground for meeting.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Copperhead was quite well—she was quite well—her
son was quite well. She hoped Mr. Beecham was well.
She had heard that most people were pleased with the ball,
thank you. Oh, Miss Beecham was going away—indeed! She
hoped the weather would be good; and then Mrs. Copperhead
sat erect upon her sofa, and did not try to say any more.
Though she had not the heart of a mouse, she too could play
the great lady when occasion served. Clarence, however, was
much more hospitable than his mother. He liked Phœbe, who
could talk almost as if she was in society, as girls talk in novels.
He knew, of course, that she was not in society, but she was
a girl whom a fellow could get on with, who had plenty to say
for herself, who was not a lay figure like many young ladies;
and then she was pretty, pink, and golden, “a piece of colour”
which was attractive to the eye. He soon found out where she
was going, and let her know that he himself intended a visit to
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>“The Dorsets live near,” he said. “Relations of my mother.
You saw them at the ball. I dare say you will meet them
somewhere about.” This, it is to be feared, Clarence said in
something of his mother's spirit, with a warm sense of superiority,
for he knew that the pastor's daughter was very unlikely
to meet the Dorsets. Phœbe, however, was equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>“I am not at all likely to meet them,” she said with a gracious
smile. “For one thing, I am not going to enjoy myself,
but to nurse a sick person. And sick people don't go to parties.
Besides, you know the foolish prejudices of society, properly
so called. I think them foolish because they affect me,” said
Phœbe, with engaging frankness. “If they did not affect me,
probably I should think them all right.”</p>

<p>“What foolish prejudices?” said Clarence, thinking she was
about to say something about her inferior position, and already
feeling flattered before she spoke.</p>

<p>“About Dissenters, you know,” she said; “of course, you
must be aware that we are looked down upon in society. It
does not matter, for when people have any sense, as soon as they
know us they do us justice; but of course you must be aware that
the prejudice exists.”</p>

<p>Clarence did know, and with some bitterness; for Mr.
Copperhead, though he did not care much, perhaps, about
religion, cared for his chapel, and stood by it with unswerving
strictness. His son, who was an Oxford man, and respectful
of all the prejudices of society, did not like this. But what
could he do against the obstinate dissentership of his father?
This, as much as anything else, had acted upon the crowd the
night of the ball, and made them all nobodies. He hesitated
to make any reply, and his face flushed with shame and displeasure.
Phœbe felt that she had avenged upon Clarence his
mother's haughty politeness. She had brought home to him a
sense of the social inferiority which was common to them both.
Having done this, she was satisfied, and proceeded to soften
the blow.</p>

<p>“It cannot fall upon you, who are in so much better a
position, as it does upon us,” said Phœbe. “We are the very
head and front of the offending, a Dissenting minister's family!—Society
and its charms are not for us. And I hope we know
our place,” she said, with mock humility; “when people have
any sense and come to know us it is different; and for the
foolish ones I don't care. But you see from that, I am not
likely to meet your cousins, am I?” she added with a laugh.</p>

<p>“If you mean that they are among the foolish ones——”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; I don't. But you can't suppose they will take
the trouble to find <i>me</i> out. Why should they? People entirely
out of my range, and that have nothing to do with me. So
you may be quite sure I am right when I say we sha'n't meet.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Clarence, piqued, “I am going to Easton,
and I shall see you, if Mrs. Beecham will give me permission
to call.”</p>

<p>“She will give you the address along with that; but till then,
good-bye,” said Phœbe. To tell the truth, she had no desire
to see Clarence Copperhead in Carlingford. Perhaps he meant
something, perhaps he did not—at this stage of the proceedings
it was a matter of indifference to Phœbe, who certainly had
not allowed “her affections” to become engaged. If he did
mean anything, was it likely that he could support unmoved
the grandfather and grandmother who were, or had been, “in
trade?” On the other hand, was it not better that he should
know the worst? Phœbe was no husband-hunter. She contemplated
the issue with calm and composure, however it might
turn out.</p>

<p>“He asked me if he might call,” said Mrs. Beecham, in some
excitement. “I don't care much to have you seen, my darling,
out of your own father's house.”</p>

<p>“Just as you please, mamma—just as it suits best,” said
Phœbe, dismissing the subject. She was not anxious. A good
deal depended on whether he meant anything or nothing, but
even that did not conclude the subject, for she had not made
up her own mind.</p>

<p>“Why didn't you tell them about the Mays?” said Clarence,
as the two ladies went out. “They live in Carlingford, and I
should think it would be pleasant on both sides.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, you forget the difference of position,” said
Mrs. Copperhead. “They are Dissenters.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I like that,” cried Clarence, half angry, as himself
sharing the disadvantages of the connection. “A needy beggar
like May has a great deal to stand upon. I like that.”</p>

<p>“But it is true all the same,” said Mrs. Copperhead, shaking
her head. “And you can see the difference at once. I dare
say Miss Beecham is a very clever young woman, but between
her and Miss May what a difference there is! Any one can
see it—”</p>

<p>“I am afraid then I am stupid, for I can't see it, mother.
They are both pretty girls, but for amusing you and that sort
of thing give me Phœbe. She is worth twenty of the other.
As sharp as a needle, and plenty to say for herself. This is
the kind of girl I like.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry for it. I hope that is not the kind of wife
you will like,” said Mrs. Copperhead, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Oh, wife! they haven't a penny, either the one or the other,”
said Clarence, with delightful openness, “and we may be sure
that would not suit the governor even if it suited me.”</p>

<p>In the mean time Mrs. Beecham and Phœbe were walking up
the broad pavement of Portland Place towards their home.</p>

<p>“It is pleasant to see the mother and the son together,” said
Mrs. Beecham, who was determined to see everything in the
best light that concerned the Copperheads. “They are so
devoted to each other, and, Phœbe, dear—I don't like to talk
in this way to a sensible girl like you, but you must see it
with your own eyes. You have certainly made a great impression
upon Clarence Copperhead. When he said he hoped to see
you in Carlingford, and asked, might he call? it was exactly
like asking my permission to pay you his addresses; it is very
flattering, but it is embarrassing as well.”</p>

<p>“I do not feel particularly flattered, mamma; and I think
if I were you I would not give him the address.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Beecham looked anxiously in her daughter's face.</p>

<p>“Is it from prudence, Phœbe, or is it that you don't like
him, that you wouldn't have him if he asked you?”</p>

<p>“We must wait till he does ask me,” said Phœbe, decisively.
“Till then I can't possibly tell. But I don't want him at
Carlingford. I know that grandpapa and grandmamma are—in
trade.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” said Mrs. Beecham, in a subdued voice.</p>

<p>“Dissenters, and in trade; and he is going to stay with the
Dorsets, fine county people. Don't give him the address; if
we meet by chance, there is no harm done. I am not ashamed
of any one belonging to me. But you can say that you don't
think his father would like him to be visiting me at Carlingford—which
I am sure would be quite true.”</p>

<p>“Indeed he might go much farther without finding any one
so well worth visiting,” said the mother, indignant, to which
Phœbe nodded her head in tranquil assent.</p>

<p>“That is neither here nor there,” she said; “you can always
tell him so, and that will please Mr. Copperhead, if ever he
comes to hear of it. He thought at one time that I was too
entertaining. One knows what that means. I should like
him to see how little I cared.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear, Clarence Copperhead would be worth—a
little attention. He could give a girl—a very nice position,”
Mrs. Beecham faltered, looking at her daughter between every
word.</p>

<p>“I am not saying anything against Clarence Copperhead,”
said Phœbe, with composure, “but I should like his dear papa
to know how little I care, and that you have refused him my
address.”</p>

<p>This was all she said on the subject. Phœbe was quite ready
to allow that Clarence was everything that her mother had said,
and she had fully worked out her own theory on marriage,
which will probably be hereafter expounded in these pages, so
that she was not at all shocked by having his advantages thus
pointed out to her. But there was no hurry, she said to herself.
If it was not Clarence Copperhead, it would be some one
else, and why should she, at this early stage of her career,
attempt to precipitate the designs of Providence? She had
plenty of time before her, and was in no hurry for any change;
and a genuine touch of nature in her heart made her anxious
for an opportunity of showing her independence to that arrogant
and offensive “leading member,” who made the life of the
office-bearers in the Crescent a burden to them. If she could
only so drive him into a corner, that he should be obliged to
come to her in his despair, and beg her to accept his son's hand
to save him from going off in a galloping consumption, that
would have been a triumph after Phœbe's heart. To be sure
this was a perfectly vain and wildly romantic hope—it was the
only bit of wild and girlish romance in the bosom of a very
well-educated, well-intentioned, and sensible young woman.
She had seen her parents put up with the arrogance of the
millionnaire for a long time without rebelling any more than they
did; but Mr. Copperhead had gone further than Phœbe could
bear; and thoroughly as she understood her own position, and
all its interests, this one vain fancy had found a footing in her
mind. If she could but humble him and make him sue to her.
It was not likely, but for such a triumph the sensible Phœbe
would have done much. It was the one point on which she
was silly, but on that she was as silly as any cynic could desire.</p>

<p>And thus with a huge trunk full of charming dresses, a
dressing-case fit for any bride, the prettiest travelling costume
imaginable, and everything about her fit, Mrs. Beecham fondly
thought, for a duke's daughter, Phœbe junior took her departure,
to be the comfort of her grandmamma, and to dazzle
Carlingford. Her fond parents accompanied her to the station
and placed her in a carriage, and fee'd a guard heavily to take
care of and watch over her. “Not but that Phœbe might be
safely trusted to take care of herself anywhere,” they said. In
which expression of their pride in their daughter, the observant
reader may see a proof of their own origin from the humbler
classes. They would probably have prided themselves on her
timidity and helplessness had they been a little better born.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XII"/>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>GRANGE LANE.</h3>


<p>Mr. and Mrs. Tozer had retired from business several years
before. They had given up the shop with its long established
connection, and all its advantages, to Tom, their son, finding
themselves to have enough to live upon in ease, and indeed
luxury; and though Mrs. Tozer found the house in Grange
Lane shut in by the garden walls to be much duller than her
rooms over the shop in High Street, where she saw everything
that was going on, yet the increase in gentility was unquestionable.
The house which they were fortunate enough to secure
in this desirable locality had been once in the occupation of
Lady Weston, and there was accordingly an aroma of high life
about it, although somebody less important had lived in it in
the mean time, and it had fallen into a state of considerable
dilapidation, which naturally made it cheaper. Mr. Tozer had
solidly repaired all that was necessary for comfort, but he had
not done anything in those external points of paint and decoration,
which tells so much in the aspect of a house. Lady
Weston's taste had been florid, and the walls continued as she
had left them, painted and papered with faded wreaths, which
were apt to look dissipated, as they ought to have been refreshed
and renewed years before. But outside, where the wreaths do
not fade, there was a delightful garden charmingly laid out, in
which Lady Weston had once held her garden parties, and
where the crocuses and other spring bulbs, which had been put
in with a lavish hand, during Lady Weston's extravagant
reign, had already begun to blow. The violets were peeping
out from among their leaves on a sheltered bank, and Christmas
roses, overblown, making a great show with their great
white stars, in a corner. Tozer himself soon took a great
interest in this little domain out of doors, and was for ever
pottering about the flowers, obeying, with the servility of ignorance,
the gardener's injunctions. Mrs. Tozer, however, who
was in weak health, and consequently permitted to be somewhat
cross and contradictory, regretted the High Street.</p>

<p>“Talk of a garden,” she said, “a thing as never changes
except according to the seasons! Up in the town there was
never a day the same, something always happening—Soldiers
marching through, or Punch and Judy, or a row at the least.
It is the cheerfullest place in the whole world, I do believe;
shut up here may do for the gentry, but I likes the streets and
what's going on. You may call me vulgar if you please, but
so I do.”</p>

<p>Tozer prudently said nothing to such outbursts except a
soothing exhortation to wait till summer, when she would find
the benefit of the fresh air, not to speak of the early vegetables;
and he himself found the garden an unspeakable resource. At
first, indeed, he would stroll up to the shop of a morning,
especially if any new consignment of first-rate York hams, or
cheese, was coming in, which he loved to turn over and test
by smell and touch; but by and by the ancient butterman
made a discovery, such as we are all apt to make when we get
old and step out of the high road of life. He found out that
his son did not appreciate his advice, and that Mrs. Tom cared
still less for his frequent appearances. Indeed, he himself
once saw her bounce out of the shop as he entered, exclaiming
audibly, “Here's that fussy old man again.” Tozer was an old
man, it is true, but nobody (under eighty) cares to have the
epithet flung in his teeth; and to be in the way is always unpleasant.
He had self-command enough to say nothing about
it, except in a very modified shape to his wife, who was ready
enough to believe anything unpleasant about Mrs. Tom; but
he took to gardening with ardour from that day; and learned
all about the succession of the flowers, and how long one set
lasted, and which kind should be put into the ground next.
He would even take off his coat and do a tolerable day's work
under the gardener's direction, to the great advantage of his
health and temper, while Mrs. Tozer grumbled upstairs. She
was getting more and more helpless about the house, unable to
see after the stout maid-of-all-work, who in her turn grumbled
much at the large house, for which one maid was not enough.
Many altercations took place in consequence between the
mistress and servant.</p>

<p>“The ungrateful hussy hasn't even as many rooms to do as
she had in the High Street, when there was the 'prentices' beds
to make,” Mrs. Tozer said indignantly to her husband; but
Jane on her side pointed to the length of passage, the stairs,
the dining and drawing-rooms, where there had once only been
a parlour.</p>

<p>“Cook and 'ousemaid's little enough,” said Jane; “there
did ought to be a man in this kind of 'ouse; but as there's only
two in family, shouldn't say nothing if I had a girl under
me.”</p>

<p>Things were gravitating towards this girl at the time of
Phœbe's arrival; but nothing had as yet been finally decided
upon. Jane, however, had bestirred herself to get the young
lady's room ready with something like alacrity. A young
person coming to the house promised a little movement and
change, which was always something, and Jane had no doubt
that Phœbe would be on her side in respect to the “girl.” “She'll
want waiting upon, and there'll always be sending of errands,”
Jane said to herself. She knew by experience “what young
'uns is in a house.”</p>

<p>There was something, perhaps, in all the preparations for her
departure which had thrown dust in Phœbe Beecham's eyes.
She had been too sharp-sighted not to see into her mother's
qualms and hesitations about her visit to Carlingford, and the
repeated warnings of both parents as to the “difference from
what she had been accustomed to;” and she thought she had
fully prepared herself for what she was to encounter. But
probably the elaborate outfit provided by her mother and the
importance attached to her journey had to some degree
obliterated this impression, for it is certain that when Phœbe
saw an old man in a shabby coat, with a wisp of a large white
neckcloth round his throat, watching anxiously for the arrival
of the train as it came up, she sustained a shock which she had
not anticipated. It was about five years since she had seen
her grandfather, an interval due to hazard rather than purpose,
though, on the whole, the elder Beechams had not been sorry
to keep their parents and their children apart. Phœbe, however,
knew her grandfather perfectly well as soon as she saw
him, though he had not perceived her, and was wandering
anxiously up and down in search of her. She held back in her
corner for the moment, to overcome the shock. Yes, there
could be no doubt about it; there he was, he whom she was
going to visit, under whose auspices she was about to appear in
Carlingford. He was not even like an old Dissenting minister,
which had been her childish notion of him. He looked neither
more nor less than what he was, an old shopkeeper, very decent
and respectable, but a little shabby and greasy, like the men
whose weekly bills she had been accustomed to pay for her
mother. She felt an instant conviction that he would call her
“Ma'am,” if she went up to him, and think her one of the
quality. Poor Phœbe! she sat back in her corner and gave a
gasp of horror and dismay, but having done this, she was herself
again. She gave herself a shake, like one who is about to
take a plunge, rose lightly to her feet, took up her bag, and
stepped out of the carriage, just as Mr. Tozer strolled anxiously
past for the third time.</p>

<p>“Grandpapa!” she cried with a smile. Mr. Tozer was
almost as much taken aback by this apparition as Phœbe herself
had been. He knew that his daughter had made great
strides in social elevation, and that her children, when he had
seen them last, had been quite like “gentlefolk's children;”
but to see this young princess step forth graciously out of a
first-class carriage, and address him as “grandpapa,” took away
his breath.</p>

<p>“Why—why—why, Miss! you ain't little Phœbe?” he
cried, scared out of his seven senses, as he afterwards said.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, I am little Phœbe,” she said, coming up and
kissing him dutifully. She was half-disgusted, he half-frightened;
but yet it was right, and Phœbe did it. “I have only
two boxes and a bag,” she said, “besides my dressing-case. If
you will get a cab, grandpapa, I will go and see after the
luggage.”</p>

<p>Old Tozer thought he could have carried the bag himself,
and left the boxes to follow; but he succumbed humbly and
obeyed.</p>

<p>“She don't seem a bit proud,” he said to himself; “but, good
Lord, what'll she ever say to my old woman?”</p>

<p>He saw the contrast very clearly between his wife and this
splendid grandchild. It did not strike him so much in his own
case.</p>

<p>“How is grandmamma?” said Phœbe, blandly; “better, I
hope? Mamma was so sorry not to come herself; but you
know, of course, she has a great many things to do. People in
town are obliged to keep up certain appearances. You are a
great deal better off in the country, grandpapa.”</p>

<p>“Lord bless you, my dear, do you call Carlingford the
country?” said Mr. Tozer. “That is all you know about it.
Your granny and I are humble folks, but the new minister at
Salem is one as keeps up appearances with the best. Your
mother was always inclined for that. I hope she has not
brought you up too fine for the likes of us.”</p>

<p>“I hope not, indeed,” said Phœbe. “No fear of my being
too fine for my duty, grandpapa. Do you live down this nice
road? How pretty it is! how delightful these gardens must
be in summer. I beg your pardon for calling it the country.
It is so quiet and so nice, it seems the country to me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, to be sure; brought up in the London smoke,” said
Mr. Tozer. “I don't suppose, now, you see a bit of green from
year's end to year's end? Very bad for the 'ealth, that is;
but I can't say you look poorly on it. Your colour's fresh, so
was your mother's before you. To be sure, she wasn't cooped
up like you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we do get a little fresh air sometimes—in the parks, for
instance,” said Phœbe. She was somewhat piqued by the idea
that she was supposed to live in London smoke.</p>

<p>“Ah, the parks are always something; but I suppose it takes
you a day's journey to get at them,” said Mr. Tozer, shaking
his head. “You mustn't mind your grandmother's temper just
at first, my dear. She's old, poor soul, and she ain't well, and
she's sometimes cross above a bit. But she'll be that proud of
you, she won't know if she's on her 'eels or 'er 'ead; and as
for a cross word now and again, I hope as you won't mind—”</p>

<p>“I shan't mind anything, grandpapa,” said Phœbe, sweetly,
“so long as I can be of use.”</p>

<p>And these were, indeed, the dutiful sentiments with which
she made her entry upon this passage in her life, not minding
anything but to be of use. The first glimpse of old Tozer,
indeed, made it quite evident to Phœbe that nothing but duty
could be within her reach. Pleasure, friends, society, the
thought of all such delights must be abandoned. And as for
Clarence Copperhead and the Miss Dorsets, the notion of
meeting or receiving them was too absurd. But Duty remained,
and Phœbe felt herself capable of the sacrifice demanded from
her. That confidence in herself which we have already indicated
as a marked feature in her character, gave her the consoling
certainty that she could not suffer from association with
her humble relations. Whosoever saw her must do her justice,
and that serene conviction preserved her from all the throes
of uneasy pride which afflict inferior minds in similar circumstances.
She had no wish to exhibit her grandfather and
grandmother in their lowliness, nor to be ostentatious of her
homely origin, as some people are in the very soreness of
wounded pride; but if hazard produced the butterman in the
midst of the finest of her acquaintances, Phœbe would still
have been perfectly at her ease. She would be herself, whatever
happened.</p>

<p>In the mean time, however, it was apparent that Duty was
what she had to look to; Duty, and that alone. She had come
here, not to amuse herself, not to please herself, but to do her
duty; and having thus concluded upon her object, she felt
comparatively happy, and at her ease.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tozer had put on her best cap, which was a very gorgeous
creation. She had dressed herself as if for a party, with
a large brooch, enclosing a curl of various coloured hair cut
from the heads of her children in early life, which fastened a
large worked collar over a dress of copper-coloured silk, and
she rustled and shook a good deal as she came downstairs into
the garden to meet her grandchild, with some excitement and
sense of the “difference” which could not but be felt on one
side as well as on the other. She, too, was somewhat frightened
by the appearance of the young lady, who was her Phœbe's
child, yet was so unlike any other scion of the Tozer race; and
felt greatly disposed to curtsey and say “Ma'am” to her.</p>

<p>“You've grown a deal and changed a deal since I saw you
last,” she said, restraining this impression, and receiving
Phœbe's kiss with gratified, yet awe-struck feeling; and then
her respectful alarm getting too much for her, she added, faltering,
“You'll find us but humble folks; perhaps not altogether
what you've been used to—”</p>

<p>Phœbe did not think it expedient to make any reply to this
outburst of humility.</p>

<p>“Grandmamma, I am afraid you have over-exerted yourself,
coming downstairs to meet me,” she said, taking the old lady's
hand, and drawing it within her arm. “Yes, I have grown; I
am tall enough to be of some use; but you must not treat me
as if I were a stranger. No, no; never mind my room. I am
not tired; the journey is nothing. Let me take you back to
your chair and make you comfortable. I feel myself quite at
home already. The only odd thing is that I have never been
here before.”</p>

<p>“Ah, my dear, your mother thought too much of you to
send you to the likes of us; that's the secret of it. She was
always fond of fine folks, was my Phœbe; and I don't blame
her, bringing you up quite the lady as she's done.”</p>

<p>“You must not find fault with mamma,” said Phœbe, smiling.
“What a nice cozy room! This is the dining-room, I suppose;
and here is your cushion, and your footstool at this nice window.
How pleasant it is, with the crocuses in all the borders already!
I am not at all tired; but I am sure it must be tea-time, and I
should so like a cup of tea.”</p>

<p>“We thought,” said Mrs. Tozer, “as perhaps you mightn't
be used to tea at this time of day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is the right time; it is the fashionable hour,” said
Phœbe; “everybody has tea at five. I will run upstairs first,
and take off my hat, and make myself tidy. Jane—is that her
name?—don't trouble, grandmamma; Jane will show me the
way.”</p>

<p>“Well?” said Mr. Tozer to Mrs. Tozer, as Phœbe disappeared.
The two old people looked at each other with a little
awe; but she, as was her nature, took the most depressing
view. She shook her head.</p>

<p>“She is a deal too fine for us, Tozer,” she said. “She'll never
make herself 'appy in our quiet way. Phœbe's been and brought
her up quite the lady. It ain't as her dress is much matter. I'd
have given her a silk myself, and never thought of it twice; and
something lively like for a young person, 'stead of that gray
stuff, as her mother might wear. But all the same, she ain't
one of our sort. She'll never make herself 'appy with you and
me.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tozer, who was more cheerful, “she ain't
proud, not a bit; and as for manners, you don't pay no more
for manners. She came up and give me a kiss in the station,
as affectionate as possible. All I can say for her is as she ain't
proud.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tozer shook her head; but even while she did so,
pleasanter dreams stole into her soul.</p>

<p>“I hope I'll be well enough to get to chapel on Sunday,”
she said, “just to see the folk's looks. The minister needn't
expect much attention to his sermon. 'There's Phœbe Tozer's
daughter!' they'll all be saying, and a-staring, and a-whispering.
It ain't often as anything like her is seen in chapel,
that's a fact,” said the old lady, warming into the exultation of
natural pride.</p>

<p>Phœbe, it must be allowed, had a good cry when she got
within the shelter of her own room, which had been very carefully
prepared for her, with everything that was necessary for
comfort, according to her grandmother's standard; but where
the “tent” bed hung with old-fashioned red and brown chintz,
and the moreen curtains drooping over the window, and the
gigantic flowers on the carpet, made Phœbe's soul sick within
her. Notwithstanding all her courage, her heart sank. She
had expected “a difference,” but she had not looked for her
grandfather's greasy coat and wisp of neckcloth, or her grandmother's
amazing cap, or the grammatical peculiarities in which
both indulged. She had a good hot fit of crying, and for the
moment felt so discouraged and depressed, that the only impulse
in her mind was to run away. But her temperament did not
favour panics, and giving in was not in her. If somebody must
do it, why should not she do it? she said to herself. How
many times had she heard in sermons and otherwise that no one
ought to look for the sweet without the bitter, and that duty
should never be avoided or refused because it is unpleasant?
Now was the time to put her principles to the test; and the
tears relieved her, and gave her something of the feeling of a
martyr, which is always consolatory and sweet; so she dried
her eyes, and bathed her face, and went downstairs cheerful
and smiling, resolved that, at all costs, her duty should be
done, however disagreeable it might be. What a good thing
the new fashion of five o'clock tea is for people who have connections
in an inferior path of life who make tea a meal, and don't
dine, or dine in the middle of the day! This was the thought
that passed through Phœbe's mind as she went into the dining-room,
and found the table covered, not to say groaning under
good things. She took her place at it, and poured out tea for
the old people, and cut bread-and-butter with the most gracious
philosophy. Duchesses did the same every day; the tea-table
had renewed its ancient sway, even in fashionable life. It cannot
be told what a help and refreshment this thought was to
Phœbe's courageous heart.</p>

<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIII"/>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>THE TOZER FAMILY.</h3>


<p>When Phœbe woke next morning, under the huge flowers
of the old fashioned cotton drapery of her “tent” bed, to see
the faint daylight struggling in through the heavy curtains
which would not draw back from the window, the discouragement
of her first arrival for a moment overpowered her again—and
with even more reason—for she had more fully ascertained
the resources of the place in which she found herself. There
were no books, except some old volumes of sermons and a few
back numbers of the Congregational Magazine, no visitors, so
far as she could make out, no newspaper but the Carlingford
Weekly Gazette, nothing but her grandmother's gossip about
the chapel and Mrs. Tom to pass the weary hours away. Even
last night Mrs. Tozer had asked her whether she had not any
work to beguile the long evening, which Phœbe occupied much
more virtuously, from her own point of view, in endeavouring
to amuse the old people by talking to them. Though it was
morning, and she ought to have been refreshed and encouraged
by the repose of the night, it was again with a few
hot tears that Phœbe contemplated her prospects. But this
was only a passing weakness. When she went down to breakfast,
she was again cheerful as the crocuses that raised their
heads along the borders with the promise of summer in them.
The sun was shining, the sky was frosty, but blue. After all,
her present sufferings could not endure for ever. Phœbe
hurried to get dressed, to get her blue fingers warned by the
dining-room fire. It is needless to say that there was no fire,
or thought of a fire in the chilly room, with its red and brown
hangings, in which Mrs. Tozer last night had hoped she would
be happy. “No fear of that, grandmamma,” she had answered
cheerfully. This was as much a lie, she felt, as if it had been
said with the wickedest intentions—was it as wrong? How
cold it was, and yet how stifling! She could scarcely fasten
the ribbon at her neck, her fingers were so cold.</p>

<p>“Yes, grandpapa, it is brighter than in London. We don't
live in the city, you know. We live in rather a pretty neighbourhood
looking out on Regent's Park, but it is seldom so bright
as the country. Sometimes the fog blows up our way, when
the wind is in the east; but it is warmer, I think,” said
Phœbe, with a little shiver, stooping over the dining-room fire.</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Mrs. Tozer, shaking her head, “it's your mother
as has spoilt you, I don't make no doubt, with fires and things.
That takes the hardiness out of young folks. A little bit of
cold is wholesome, it stirs up the blood. Them as is used to
fires is always taking cold. One good fire in the sitting-room,
that's always been my principle, and them as is cold if they
can't warm theirselves with movin' about, which is far the
best, let them come and warm their fingers when they please—as
you may be doing now.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is a very good principle, grandmamma,” said
Phœbe, “when one is used to it; but the country is colder
than town. Where there are fires on every side you must have
more warmth than in a detached house like this. But it is only
my hands after all. Shall I make the tea?”</p>

<p>“You should wear mittens like me—I always did in the
High Street, especial when I was going and coming to the shop,
helping serve, when the children were young and I had the
time for it. Ah! we've done with all that now. We're more
at our ease, but I can't say as we're much happier. A shop
is a cheerful sort of thing. I dare say your mother has told
you—”</p>

<p>“No,” said Phœbe, under her breath; but the reply was not
noticed. She nearly dropped the teapot out of her hand when
she heard the word—Shop! Yes, to be sure, that was what
being “in trade” meant, but she had never quite realized it till
now. Phœbe was going through a tremendous piece of mental
discipline in these first days. She writhed secretly, and moaned
to herself—why did not mamma tell me? but she sat quite
still outside, and smiled as if it was all quite ordinary and
natural, and she had heard about the shop all her life. It
seemed cruel and unkind to have sent her here without distinct
warning of what she was going to meet. But Phœbe was a
good girl, and would not blame her father and mother. No
doubt they meant it “for the best.”</p>

<p>“Is Uncle Tom,” she said, faltering somewhat, “in the—shop
now?”</p>

<p>“If I'm able,” said Mrs. Tozer, “I'll walk that far with you
this morning—or Tozer, I mean your grandfather, will go. It's
a tidy house o' business, though I say it as shouldn't, seeing it
was him and me as made it all; though I don't hold with Mrs.
Tom's nonsense about the new windows. Your Uncle Tom is as
innocent as innocent, but as for her, she ain't no favourite of
mine, and I makes no bones about saying so, I don't mind who
hears.”</p>

<p>“She ain't so bad as you make her out,” said Tozer. “She's
kind enough in her way. Your grandmother is a-going to
show you off—that's it, my dear. She can't abide Tom's wife,
and she wants to show her as you're far finer than her girls.
I don't say no. It's nat'ral, and I'm not one as stands against
nature; but don't you be prejudiced by my old woman there.
She <i>is</i> a prejudiced one. Nothing in the world will make her
give up a notion when she's took it into her head.”</p>

<p>“No, nothing; and ain't I always right in the end? I
should think you've proved that times enough,” said the old
woman. “Yes, I'll take a little, my dear, since you press me
so pretty. Folks take many a thing when they're pressed as
they wouldn't touch if there was no one to say, take a bit.
Tozer, he never thinks of that; he's always had the best o'
appetites; but as for me, if I get's a cup o' tea that's all as I
cares for. You'll see as she'll take my view, when she's once
been to the High Street. She's her mother's daughter, and
Phœbe can't abide that woman, no more than me.”</p>

<p>“Have they got many children?” said Phœbe. “I know
there are two girls, but as I have never seen them—Are they
as old as I am?” she asked, with a tremulous feeling at her
heart. If there were girls in the shop in the High Street,
with whom she would have to be on familiar terms, as her
cousins and equals, Phœbe did not feel that she could put up
with that.</p>

<p>“The eldest, Polly, is only twelve,” said Tozer; “but never
you mind, my dear, for you shan't be without company. There's
a deal of families with daughters like yourself. Your grandmother
won't say nothing against it; and as for me, I think
there's nought so cheery as young folks. You shall have a fire
in the drawing-room, and as many tea-parties as you like. For
the young men, I can't say as there's many, but girls is plenty,
and as long as you're content with that—”</p>

<p>Mrs. Tozer regarded him with withering contempt across the
table.</p>

<p>“You're clever ones, you men,” she said. “Families with
daughters! Do you think the Greens and the Robbins is
company for <i>her</i>? I dare say as you've heard your mother speak
of Maria Pigeon, my dear? She married John Green the
grocer, and very well to do and respectable they may be, but
nobody but the likes of your grandfather would think of you
and them making friends.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I don't care for making friends,” said Phœbe, “you
must remember that I came not for society, but to wait upon
you, dear grandmamma. I don't want young friends. At
home I always go out with my mother; let me take walks with
you, when you are able. I am glad Uncle Tom's children are
little. I don't want company. My work—and the garden—and
to sit with grandmamma, that is all I care for. I shall
be as happy as the day is long,” said this martyr, smiling benignly
over the aches in her heart.</p>

<p>Her grandparents looked at her with ever-growing pride.
Was not this the ideal young woman, the girl of the story-books,
who cared about nothing but her duty?</p>

<p>“That's very nice of you, my dear; but you ain't going to
hide yourself up in a corner,” said Tozer. And, “Never fear,
I'll take her wherever it's fit for her to go to,” his wife added,
looking at her with pride. Phœbe felt, in addition to all the
rest, that she was to be made a show of to all the connection,
as a specimen of what the Tozer blood could come to, and she did
not even feel sure that something of the same feeling had not
been in her mother's bosom when she fitted her out so perfectly.
Phœbe Tozer had left contemporaries and rivals in Carlingford,
and the thought of dazzling and surpassing them in her offspring
as in her good fortune had still some sweetness for her
mind. “Mamma meant it too!” Phœbe junior said to herself
with a sigh. Unfortunately for her, she did everybody credit
who belonged to her, and she must resign herself to pay the
penalty. Perhaps there was some compensation in that
thought.</p>

<p>And indeed Phœbe did not wonder at her grandmother's
pride when she walked up with her to High Street, supporting
her on her arm. She recognised frankly that there were not
many people like herself about, few who had so much the air of
good society, and not one who was so well dressed. There were
excuses to be made then for the anxiety of the old people to
produce her in the little world which was everything to them,
and with her usual candour and good sense she acknowledged
this, though she winced a little when an occasional acquaintance
drifted across Mrs. Tozer's path, and was introduced with
pride to “my granddaughter,” and thrust forth an ungloved
hand, with an exclamation of, “Lord bless us, Phœbe's eldest!
I hope I see you well, Miss.” Phœbe continued urbane,
though it cost her many a pang. She had to keep on a perpetual
argument with herself as she went along slowly, holding
up her poor grandmother's tottering steps. “If this is what
we have really sprung from, this is my own class, and I ought
to like it; if I don't like it, it must be my fault. I have no
right to feel myself better than they are. It is not position
that makes any difference, but individual character,” Phœbe
said to herself. She got as much consolation out of this as is
to be extracted from such rueful arguments in general; but it
was after all indifferent comfort, and had not her temperament
given her a strong hold of herself, and power of subduing her
impulses, it is much to be feared that Phœbe would have
dropped her grandmother's arm as they approached the station,
and run away. She did waver for a moment as she came in
sight of it. On that side lay freedom, comfort, the life she had
been used to, which was not very elevated indeed, but felt like
high rank in comparison with this. And she knew her parents
would forgive her and defend her if she went back to them,
unable to support the martyrdom which she had rashly taken
upon herself. But then how weak that would be, Phœbe
thought to herself, drawing Mrs. Tozer's arm more tightly
within her own—how small! how it would hurt the feelings of
the old people, how it would vex and embarrass her father and
mother! Lastly, it might peril her brother's interests and her
own, which, to do her justice, was the last thing she thought of,
and yet was not undeserving of notice in its way.</p>

<p>“Lean on me more heavily, grandmamma,” she said at last,
finally concluding and throwing off this self-discussion. She
could not prolong it further. It was unworthy of her. Hence-forward
she had made up her mind to set her face like a flint,
and no longer leave the question of her persistence in her
domestic mission an open question. Whatever she might have
“to put up with,” it was now decided once for all.</p>

<p>“Bless us all, if this ain't grandmamma,” said Mrs. Tom. It
was not often, as she herself said with pride, that she required to
be in the shop, which was very much improved now from its old
aspect. Ill luck, however, brought her here to-day. She stood
at the door which led from the shop to the house, dividing the
counter, talking to a lady who was making a complaint upon
the quality of cheese or butter. Mrs. Tozer had led Phœbe
that way in order to point out to her the plate-glass windows
and marble slabs for the cheese, of which, though they were
one of her grievances against Mrs. Tom, she was secretly
proud.</p>

<p>“I don't deny but what they've done a deal,” said the old
woman, “show and vanity as I call it. I wish they may do as
well for themselves with all their plate-glass as me and Tozer
did without it; but it ain't often as you'll see a handsomer
shop,” she added, contemplating fondly the scene of her early
labours. If a squire looks fondly at his land, and a sailor at
his ship (when ships were worth looking at), why should not a
shopkeeper regard his shop with the same affectionate feelings?
Mrs. Tom Tozer had just taken leave of her remonstrant
customer with a curtsey, and an assurance that the faults complained
of should be remedied, when she caught sight of the
infirm old woman leaning on Phœbe's arm, and made the exclamation
already quoted.</p>

<p>“Lord bless us all! if it ain't grandmamma, and Phœbe's
daughter along o' her, I'll lay you sixpence,” said Mrs. Tom in the
extremity of her surprise, and at the highest pitch of her voice.
The lady customer was still in the shop, and when she heard
this she turned round and gave the new-comers a stare. (It
was not very wonderful, Phœbe allowed to herself with secret
anguish). She gave old Mrs. Tozer a familiar nod. “This is
quite a long walk for you now-a-days,” she said, gazing at
Phœbe, though she addressed the old woman.</p>

<p>“Thank ye, ma'am, I am a deal better,” said Mrs. Tozer,
“especially as I've got my granddaughter to take care of me.”</p>

<p>“Oh! is this young—person your granddaughter,” said the
customer with another stare, and then she nodded again and
went away wondering. “Well,” Phœbe said to herself, “one
little sting more or less what did it matter?” and she went on
through the shop supporting her grandmother, keenly sensible
of the looks that encountered her on every side. Mrs. Tom
stood leaning against the counter, waiting for them without
making any advance. She was smart and good-looking, with a
malicious gleam in a pair of bright black beady eyes.</p>

<p>“How are you, granny?” she said, “I declare you're looking
quite young again, and as spry as twenty. Come in and rest;
and this young lady as is with you, I don't think as I need ask
her name, the likeness speaks for itself. It's Phœbe Beecham,
ain't it? Bless us all! I'd have known her anywhere, I would;
the very moral of her mother, and of you too, granny. As you
stand there now, you're as like as two peas.”</p>

<p>Unconsciously Phœbe cast a look upon her grandmother.
She did not think she was vain. To be unconscious that she
had some personal advantages would, of course, be impossible;
but a thrill crept through her when she looked at the old
woman by her side, wrinkled and red, in her copper-coloured
gown. As like as two peas! was that possible? Phœbe's
heart sank for the moment to her shoes, and a pitiful look of
restrained pain came to her face. This was assailing her in her
tenderest point.</p>

<p>“Am I so like you, grandmamma?” she said, faltering; but
added quickly, “then I cannot be like mamma. How do you
do? My mother wished me to come at once, to bring her kind
regards. Is my uncle at home?”</p>

<p>“No, Miss, your uncle ain't at home,” said Mrs. Tom, “but
you might be civil, all the same, and put a name to me, more
nor if I was a dog. I'm your aunt, I am—and I likes all my
titles, I do—and proper respect.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said Phœbe, with a bow and a gracious smile—but
she did not add that name. She was pleased to think that
“Tom's wife” was her mother's favourite aversion, and that a
dignified resistance to her claims was, so to speak, her duty. It
even amused her to think of the ingenuity required throughout
a long conversation for the clever and polite eluding of this
claim.</p>

<p>“I hope as you mean to let us in, Amelia,” said Mrs. Tozer,
“for it ain't often as I takes so long a walk. I would never
have thought of it but for Phœbe—Phœbe junior, as Tozer
calls her. She's been used to things very different, but I'm
thankful to say she ain't a bit proud. She couldn't be more
attentive to me if I was the queen, and talks of your children
as pretty as possible, without no nonsense. It ain't often as
you see that in a girl brought up like she's been.”</p>

<p>“I don't pretend to know nothing of how she's been brought
up,” said Mrs. Tom, “and I don't think as there's no occasion
for pride here. We're all well-to-do, and getting on in the
world—thanks to Him as gives the increase. I don't see no
opening for pride here. Me and your mother were never very
good friends, Phœbe, since that's your name; but if there's
anything I can do for you, or my family, you won't ask twice.
Grandmother's ain't a very lively house, not like mine, as is
full of children. Come in, Granny. I'm always speaking of
making the stairs wider, and a big window on the landing; but
folks can't do everything at once, and we'll have to do with it
a bit longer. We've done a deal already to the old place.”</p>

<p>“More than was wanted, or was thought upon in my time,”
said the old lady, to whom this was as the trumpet of battle.
“The stairs did well enough for me, and I can't think what
Tom can want changing things as he's been used to all his
life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it ain't Tom,” said his wife, her face lighting up with
satisfaction. “Tom wouldn't mind if the place was to come to
bits about our ears. He's like you, granny, he's one of the
stand-still ones. It ain't Tom, it's me.”</p>

<p>This little passage of arms took place as they were going upstairs,
which cost poor Mrs. Tozer many pantings and groaning,
and placed Phœbe for once on Mrs. Tom's side, for a window
on the landing would have been a wonderful improvement,
there was no denying. When, at last, they had toiled to the
top, fighting their way, not only through the obscurity, but
through an atmosphere of ham and cheese which almost choked
Phœbe, the old lady was speechless with the exertion, though
the air was to her as the air of Paradise. Phœbe placed her
on a chair and undid her bonnet-strings, and for a minute
was really alarmed. Mrs. Tom, however, took it with perfect
equanimity.</p>

<p>“She's blown a bit; she ain't as young as she was, nor even
as she thinks for,” said that sympathetic person. “Come,
Granny, cheer up. Them stairs ain't strange to you. What's
the good of making a fuss? Sit down and get your breath,”
she went on, pulling forward a chair; then turning to Phœbe,
she shrugged her shoulders and raised her eyebrows. “She's
breaking fast, that's what it is,” said Mrs. Tom under her
breath, with a nod of her head.</p>

<p>“This is the room as your mother spent most of her life in
when she was like you,” said Mrs. Tozer, when she regained
her breath. “It was here as she met your father first. The
first time I set my eyes on him, 'That's the man for my
Phœbe,' I said to myself; and sure enough, so it turned out.”</p>

<p>“You didn't miss no way of helping it on, neither, granny,
if folks do you justice,” said Mrs. Tom. “Mothers can do a
deal when they exerts themselves; and now Phœbe has a
daughter of her own, I dare be sworn she's just as clever,
throwing the nice ones and the well-off ones in her way. It's
a wonder to me as she hasn't gone off yet, with all her opportunities—two
or three and twenty, ain't you, Miss Phœbe? I
should have thought you'd have married long afore now.”</p>

<p>“I stall be twenty my next birthday,” said Phœbe. “My
cousins are a great deal younger, I hear; are they at school?
I hope I shall see them before I go.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you'll see 'em fast enough,” said their mother, “they're
'aving their music lesson. I don't hold with sending girls to
school. I likes to keep them under my own eye. I suppose I
needn't ask you now if you play?”</p>

<p>“A very little,” said Phœbe, who rather piqued herself upon
her music, and who was learned in Bach and Beethoven, and
had an opinion of her own about Wagner. Mrs. Tom brightened
visibly, for her girls played not a little, but a great deal.</p>

<p>“And draw?—but I needn't ask, for living in London, you've
got masters at your very door.”</p>

<p>“Not at all, I am sorry to say,” said Phœbe, with a pathetic
tone of regret in her voice.</p>

<p>“Lord bless us! Now who'd have thought it? I think
nothing a sacrifice to give mine the best of education,” said
Mrs. Tom.</p>

<h3>STRANGERS.</h3>


<p>“Well, Ursula, how do you do?” said Mrs. Sam Hurst,
meeting her young neighbour with outstretched hands. She
was a portly good-looking woman with an active mind, and
nothing, or next to nothing to do, and instead of being affronted
as some persons might have been, she was amused, and indeed
flattered, by the suspicion and alarm with which all the young
Mays regarded her. Whether she had the least intention of
ever giving any justification to their alarms it would be impossible
to say, for indeed to a sensible woman of forty-five,
well to do and comfortable, a husband with “a temper of his
own,” and a large poor unruly family, was, perhaps, not so
tempting as he appeared to be to his jealous children. Anyhow
she was not at all angry with them for being jealous and afraid
of her. She was cordial in her manner to the Mays as to everybody
she knew. She asked how Ursula had enjoyed herself,
where she had been, what she had seen, and a hundred questions
more.</p>

<p>“It is quite delightful to see somebody who has something
to tell,” she said when the interrogation was over. “I ask
everybody what news, and no one has any news, which is
dreadful for me.”</p>

<p>“How can you care for news?” said Ursula, “news! what
interest can there be in mere news that doesn't concern us?”</p>

<p>“You are very foolish, my dear,” said Mrs. Hurst; “what's to
become of you when you're old, if you don't like to hear what's
going on? I'm thankful to say I take a great deal, of interest
in my fellow-creatures for my part. Now listen, I'll tell you a
piece of news in return for all your information about London.
When I was in Tozer's shop to-day—I always go there, though
they are Dissenters; after all, you know, most tradespeople are
Dissenters; some are sorry for it, some think it quite natural
that gentle-people and tradespeople should think differently in
religious matters; however, what I say is, you can't tell the
difference in butter and bacon between church and dissent, can
you now? and Tozer's is the best shop in the town, certainly
the best shop. So as I was in Tozer's as I tell you, who should
come in but old Mrs. Tozer, who once kept it herself—and by
her side, figure my astonishment, a young lady! yes, my dear,
actually a young lady, in appearance, of course—I mean in
appearance—for, as you shall hear, it could be no more than
that. So nicely dressed, nothing vulgar or showy, a gown
that Elise might have made, and everything to correspond,
in perfect taste. Fancy! and you may imagine how I stared.
I could not take my eyes off her. I was so astonished that
I rubbed up my old acquaintance with the old woman, and
asked her how her rheumatism was. I <i>hope</i> it is rheumatism.
At all events I called it so, and then she told me as proud as a
peacock that it was her granddaughter; fancy, her granddaughter!
did you ever hear of such a thing? The other
woman in the shop, the present Tozer, called out to her by
name. Phœbe they called her. Poor girl, I was so sorry
for her. A lady in appearance, and to have to submit to that!”</p>

<p>“Oughtn't ladies to be called Phœbe?” asked Janey. “Why
not? It's rather a pretty name.”</p>

<p>“That is so like Janey,” said Mrs. Hurst; “I know she is
the clever one; but she never can see what one means. It is not
being called Phœbe, it is because of her relations that I am
sorry for her. Poor girl! educating people out of their sphere
does far more harm than good, I always maintain. To see that
nice-looking, well-dressed girl in Tozer's shop, with all the
butter boys calling her Phœbe—”</p>

<p>“The butter boys are as good as any one else,” cried Janey,
whose tendencies were democratic. “I dare say she likes her
relations as well as we like ours, and better, though they do keep
a shop.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Janey!” cried Ursula, whose feelings were touched;
then she remembered that her sympathies ought not to flow in
the same channel with those of Mrs. Sam Hurst, and continued
coldly, “If she had not liked them she need not have come to
see them.”</p>

<p>“That is all you know, you girls. You don't know the plague
of relations, and how people have got to humble themselves to
keep money in the family, or keep up appearances, especially
people that have risen in the world. I declare I think they
pay dear for rising in the world, or their poor children pay
dear—”</p>

<p>“You seem to take a great deal of interest in the Tozers,”
said Ursula, glad to administer a little correction; “even if
they came to St. Roque's I could understand it—but Dissenters!”
This arrow struck home.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Hurst, colouring, “of all people to take
an interest in Dissenters I am the last; but I was struck, I
must admit, to see that old Mrs. Tozer, looking like an old
washerwoman, with a girl in a twenty-guinea dress, you may
take my word for it, though as plain as that little brown frock
of yours, Ursula. That was a sight to wake any one up.”</p>

<p>Ursula looked down at the little brown frock thus contemptuously
referred to, with mingled offence and consciousness of
inferiority. It had not cost as many shillings, and had been
made up at home, and was not a shining example of the dressmaker's
art. “If you value people according to what their
dress costs—”</p>

<p>“I can't know much about her moral qualities, can I?” said
Mrs. Hurst, “and I don't suppose she has any position, being
old Tozer's grandchild. But she wasn't amiss in her looks, and
I declare I should have taken her for a lady if I had met her
in the street. It shows how one may be taken in. And this
is a lesson for you, young girls; you must never trust to appearances.
I confess I'd like to find out some more about her.
Going in, Ursula? Well, my dear, perhaps I'll step in for a
talk in the evening. You must be dull after your gaiety. Tell
your dear papa,” said Mrs. Hurst with a laugh, “that I am
coming to sit with you after tea. Now mind you give him my
message. He does not like to miss me when I come to the
Parsonage, does he now? Good-bye for the present. Till
eight o'clock.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how I hate her,” cried Janey, “except sometimes when
she makes me laugh and I feel tempted to like her; but I
always resist it. Do you think really, Ursula, that papa could
be—such a—stupid—”</p>

<p>“Oh, please don't ask me,” cried Ursula. “How can I tell?
I don't know what he may do; but if he does—and if she does—oh,
then, Janey—”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, then!” said Janey, breathing hard. This
mysterious threat seemed very horrible to both of them, though
what they meant by it, it would have been very hard for either
of them to tell. They waited within the little shrubbery
whispering to each other till they heard Mrs. Hurst close her
own door, for they did not want any more of her society, though
they had no intention of going in. When she was safe out of
the way, they stole out and continued their walk in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>“I wanted to have gone into the town,” said Ursula. “It
<i>is</i> hard to have that woman next door; one can't go anywhere
or do anything! I wanted some braid for your new frock,
Janey, and twist to make the button-holes; but if we had said
we were going up into Carlingford, she would have come too.
Never mind; a walk is better than nothing. Walk fast, and
let us try how far we can go before tea.”</p>

<p>Upon this idea the two girls set out walking as if for a race,
which did them all the good in the world, quickening the blood
in their veins, sending the colour to their cheeks, and dispersing
all the cobwebs from their minds, since they soon got into the
spirit of the race, and pursued it with eagerness, with little
outbursts of laughter, and breathless adjurations to each other
to keep within the proper pace, and not to run. It was not a
very inviting road along which they took their walk. Beyond
St. Roque the land was divided into allotments for the working
people, not very tidily kept, and rough with cut cabbages,
plants, and dug-up potatoes. Beyond this lay a great turnip-field,
somewhat rank in smell, and the east wind swept chill
along the open road, which was not sheltered by a single tree,
so that the attractions of the way soon palled upon pedestrians.
Looking back to Grange Lane, the snug and sheltered look of
that genteel adjunct to the town was comforting to behold.
Even Grange Lane was not gay; a line of garden walls, however
they may shelter and comfort the gardens within, are not
lovely without; but yet the trees, though leafless, waved over
the red lines of brick, and the big laurels hung out bushes of
dark verdure and long floating sprays of ivy.</p>

<p>“Let's turn back; perhaps she may not be at the window,”
cried Ursula. “It is so dull here.”</p>

<p>Janey stopped short in the heat of the walk, objecting for
the moment.</p>

<p>“I wish you had not gone to London. You never used to
care for the streets and the shops; now a regular good walk is
too much for you,” cried Janey.</p>

<p>“With a turnip-field on one side and a potato-field on the
other!” said Ursula, in high disdain.</p>

<p>“I tell you what!” cried Janey. “I don't think I like
you since you came back. The Dorsets are fine people, and
we are not fine. There are no grand parties, nor theatres, nor
balls at Carlingford. When we go out here, we go to walk,
not to see things, as you have been used to doing. I don't
know what you mean by it; nineteen years with us, and one
fortnight with them! and the fortnight counts for more than
all the years!”</p>

<p>Janey was not in the habit of restraining her voice any more
than anything else about her, and she spoke this out with loud
school-girl tones, reckless who might hear her. In most cases
she might have done this with the utmost impunity, and how
was she to know, as she said to her sister afterwards, in self-defence,
that any one, especially any gentleman, could be lurking
about, spying upon people, among those nasty allotments?
There was some one there, however, who came down the
muddy path, all cut up by the wheel-barrows, with a smile
upon his face. A gentleman? Janey called him so without
a doubt on the subject; but Ursula, more enlightened and
slightly irritated, had her doubts. He was dressed, not with
any care of morning costume, but wore a black frock-coat of
the most formal description, with a white cravat carelessly
tied, semi-clerical, and yet not clerical. He had a smile on his
face, which, on the whole, was rather a handsome face, and
looked at them, showing evident signs of having heard what
Janey said. To be sure, he did not say anything, but Ursula
felt that his look was just the same as if he had spoken, and
coloured high, resenting the intrusion. By this stranger's side
was one of the men who had been working at the allotments,
whose hands were not clean, and whose boots were heavy with
the clinging, clayey soil. When they had nearly reached the
road, the gentleman turned round and shook hands with his
companion, and then walked on towards Carlingford, throwing
another look towards the girls as he passed. It would be hard
to say whether curiosity or anger was strongest in Ursula. In
Janey, the former sentiment carried everything before it.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wonder who he is?” she cried, low, but eager, in
her sister's ear. “Who can he be, Ursula, who can he be?
We know all the men about here, every one, as well as we know
Reginald. Oh, Ursula, who do you think he can be?”</p>

<p>“He is very impertinent,” cried Ursula, with an angry
blush. “How should I know? And oh! how very silly of
you, Janey, to talk so loud, and make impudent men stare at
us so.”</p>

<p>“Impudent!” cried Janey. “I didn't talk loud. He
looked rather nice, on the contrary. Why, he laughed! Do
you call that impudent? It can't be anybody from the town,
because we know everybody; and did you see him shaking
hands with that man? How very funny! Let us run in and
tell Mrs. Sam Hurst, and ask her who she thinks he is. She
is sure to know.”</p>

<p>“Janey,” said Ursula, severely, “if you live very long, you
will be as great a gossip and as fond of news as Mrs. Sam
Hurst herself.”</p>

<p>“I don't care,” cried Janey; “you're just as fond of news as
I am, only you won't confess it. I am dying to know who he
is. He is quite nice-looking, and tall and grand. A new
gentleman! Come, quick, Ursula; let us get back and see
where he goes.”</p>

<p>“Janey!” cried the elder sister. She was half curious herself,
but Ursula was old enough to know better, and to be
ashamed of the other's naïve and undisguised curiosity. “Oh,
what would Cousin Anne say! A girl running after a gentleman
(even if he is a gentleman), to see where he goes!”</p>

<p>“Well!” cried Janey, “if she wants to know, what else is
she to do? Who cares for Cousin Anne? She is an old maid.
Why, if it had been a lady, I shouldn't have minded. There
are so many ladies; but a new gentleman! If you won't come
on, I will run by myself. How pleased Mrs. Sam Hurst will
be!”</p>

<p>“I thought you hated Mrs. Sam Hurst?”</p>

<p>“So I do when I think of papa; but when there's anything
going on, or anything to find out, I like her dearly. She's such
fun! She never shilly-shallies, like you. She's not an old
maid like your Cousin Anne that you are always talking of.
Come along! if anybody else finds out who he is before we do,”
cried Janey, with almost despairing energy, “I shall break my
heart!”</p>

<p>Ursula stoically resisted the tug upon her, but she went back
to Grange Lane, to which, indeed, she had turned her face
before they met the stranger, and she could not help seeing
the tall black figure in front of her which Janey watched so
eagerly. Ursula was not eager, but she could not help seeing
him. He walked up the street quickly, not as if he thought
himself of interest to any one, but when he had got half way up
Grange Lane, crossed to speak to somebody. This filled Janey
with consternation.</p>

<p>“He is not such a stranger after all,” she cried. “He knows
some one. He will not be quite a discovery. Who is it he is
talking to, I wonder? He is standing at one of the doors, but
it is not Miss Humphreys, nor Miss Griffiths, nor any of the
Charters. Perhaps she is a stranger too. If he is married he
won't be half so interesting, for there are always plenty of
ladies. Perhaps he has just come by the railway to spend the
day—but then there is nothing to see in Carlingford, and how
did he know that man at the lots? Oh, Ursula, why don't you
answer me? why don't you say something? have you no feeling?
I am sure it don't matter a bit to me, for I am not out;
I am never asked to parties—but I take an interest for you
other girls' sake.”</p>

<p>Before this time, however, Ursula had found a new object of
interest. She had not been quite so unmoved as Janey supposed.
A new gentleman was a thing to awaken anybody who
knew Carlingford, for, indeed, gentlemen were scarce in the society
of the little town, and even at the most mild of tea-parties
it is ludicrous to see one man (and that most likely a
curate) among a dozen ladies—so that even when she appeared
to Janey to wonder, she felt that her sister's curiosity was not
unjustifiable. But while thus engaged in the enterprise of discovering
“a new gentleman” for the good of society, Ursula's
eyes and her attention were caught by another interest. The
stranger had crossed the street to talk to a lady, who had been
walking down the Lane, and whom Ursula felt she had seen
somewhere. Who was it? Certainly not Miss Humphreys,
nor Miss Griffiths, nor any other of the well-known young
ladies of Grange Lane. The setting sun, which had come out
suddenly after a dull day, threw a slanting, long-drawn ray up
the street, which fell upon the strangers, as they stood talking.
This ray caught the young lady's hair, and flashed back a reflection
out of the shining coils which looked to Ursula (being
dark herself, she admired golden hair more than anything) as
bright as the sunshine. And in the light she caught the out-line
of a pretty head, and of a nose slightly “tip-tilted,”
according to the model which the Laureate has brought into
fashion. Where had she seen her before? She remembered
all at once with a rush of bewildered pleasure.</p>

<p>“Janey! Oh, Janey!” she cried, “Listen! This is too
extraordinary. There is the young lady in black!”</p>

<p>Janey, as may be supposed, had heard every detail of Mrs.
Copperhead's ball, and knew what Ursula meant as well as
Ursula herself did. She grew pale with excitement and
curiosity. “No!” she said, “you can't mean it. Are you sure,
are you quite sure? Two new people in one day! Why,
everybody must be coming to Carlingford. It makes me feel
quite strange!” said this susceptible young woman; “the young
lady in black!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, there can't be any mistake,” said Ursula, hurrying
on in her excitement, “I looked at her so much. I couldn't
mistake her. Oh, I wonder if she will know me, I wonder if
she will speak to me! or if she is going to see the Dorsets, or
what has brought her to Carlingford. Only fancy, Janey, the
young lady in black whom I have talked so much of; oh, I
wonder, I do wonder what has brought her here.”</p>

<p>They were on the opposite side of the lane, so that their hurried
approach did not startle the strangers; but Phœbe, looking
up at the sound of the footsteps, saw a face she knew looking
wistfully, eagerly at her, with evident recognition. Phœbe had
a faculty quite royal of remembering faces, and it took but a
moment to recall Ursula's to her. Another moment was spent
in a rapid discussion with herself, as to whether she should give
or withhold the salutation which the girl evidently sought.
But what harm could it do? and it would be pleasant to know
some one; and if on finding out who she was, Miss Dorset's
little relation shrank from her acquaintance, why then, Phœbe
said to herself, “I shall be no worse than before.” So she sent
a smile and a bow across the road and said, “How do you do?”
in a pause of her conversation. Ursula was too shy to feel on
equal terms with the young lady in black, who was so much
more self-possessed than she was. She blushed and smiled,
answered, “Quite well, thank you,” across the lane like a child,
and notwithstanding a great many pokes from Janey's energetic
elbow, went on without further response.</p>

<p>“Oh, why can't you run across and speak to her?” cried
Janey, “oh, how funny you are, and how disagreeable! would
<i>I</i> pass any one I knew, like that!”</p>

<p>“You don't understand, you are only a child,” said Ursula,
frightened and agitated, yet full of dignity, “we have only met—in
society. When you are introduced to any one in society
it does not count. Perhaps they might not want to know
you; perhaps—but anyhow you can't rush up to them like
two girls at school. You have to wait and see what they will do.”</p>

<p>“Well, I declare!” cried Janey; “then what is the good of
society? You know them, and yet you mustn't know them.
I would never be such a fool as that. Fancy looking at her
across the lane and saying 'quite well, thank you,' after she
had begun to speak. I suppose that's Cousin Anne's way? I
should have rushed across and asked where she was staying,
and when she would come to see us. Ursula, oh,” cried
Janey, suddenly changing her tone, and looking at her sister
with eyes which had widened to twice their natural size with
the grandeur of the idea, “you will have to ask her to tea!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you silly girl, do you think she would come? you should
have seen her at the ball. She knew everybody, and had such
quantities of partners. Mr. Clarence Copperhead was always
dancing with her. Fancy her coming to tea with us.” But
Ursula herself was somewhat breathless with the suggestion.
When a thing has been once said, there is always a chance
that it may be done, and the two girls walked up very quickly
into the High Street after this, silent, with a certain awe of
themselves and their possibilities. It might be done, now that
it had been said.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XV"/>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>A DOMESTIC CRISIS.</h3>


<p>The interest shown by the two girls in the stranger whom they
had noted with so much attention was not destined to meet
with any immediate reward. Neither he, nor “the young
lady in black,” whom he hurried across the street to meet,
could be heard of, or was seen for full two days afterwards, to
the great disappointment of the young Mays. Ursula, especially,
who had been entertaining vague but dazzling thoughts of a
companionship more interesting than Janey's, more novel and
at the same time more equal than that which was extended to
her by the Miss Griffiths in Grange Lane, who were so much
better off and had so much less to do than she. Ursula did not
recollect the name of the fortunate girl who was so much in
the ascendant at Mr. Copperhead's ball, though Phœbe had
been introduced to her; but she did recollect her popularity
and general friendliness, and the number of partners she had,
and all those delightful signs of greatness which impress a poor
little stranger, to whom her first dance is not unmingled pleasure.
She whispered to Janey about her even in the drawing-room
when all the family were assembled.</p>

<p>“Do you think she will call?” said Ursula, asking counsel
even of Janey's inexperience, of which she was so contemptuous
on other occasions.</p>

<p>“Call! how can she, if she is a stranger?” said Janey.</p>

<p>“As if you knew anything about it!” Ursula retorted with
great injustice.</p>

<p>“If I don't know, then why do you ask me?” complained
Janey with reason. The room looked more cheerful since
Ursula had come home. The fire, no longer choked with cinders,
burned clear and red. The lamp, though it was a cheap one,
and burned paraffin oil, did not smell. The old curtains were
nicely drawn, and the old covers smoothed over the chairs. All
this did not make them look less old; but it made their antiquity
natural and becoming. Johnnie, the school-boy, was learning
his lessons on the rug before the fire. Reginald sat writing,
with a candle all to himself, at a writing-table in a corner.
Ursula and Janey were working at the centre table by the
light of the lamp. They had no time, you may imagine, for
fancy-work. Janey, with many contortions of her person,
especially of her mouth, with which she seemed to follow the
movements of her needle, was stitching up a sleeve of her new
frock which Miss Dorset had sent her, and which a poor dress-maker,
who “went out,” was at this moment making up in the
schoolroom; while Ursula was still busy with the basket of
stockings which she had found awaiting her on their return.
What Reginald was doing at the writing-table was probably
a great deal less useful, but the girls respected his occupation
as no one ever thought of respecting theirs, and carried on their
conversation under their breath, not to interrupt him. The
little children had gone to bed, tea was over, and several hours
of the long winter evening still before them. Janey had given
over lessons, partly because there was no one to insist upon her
doing them. Once in a week or so her father gave her a lecture
for her ignorance, and ordered her into his study to do a long
sum in arithmetic out of the first old “Colenso” that could be
picked up; and about once a week too, awakening suddenly to
a sense of her own deficiencies, she would “practise” energetically
on the old piano. This was all that was being done
for Janey in the way of education. She was fifteen, and as
Johnnie, and Amy, and Robin were at an age when school is a
necessity, the only retrenchment possible was to keep Janey
at home. Ursula had got what education she possessed in the
same irregular way. It was not much. Besides reading and
writing, she had pretty manners, which came by nature like
those other gifts. A girl is not so badly off who can read and
write and has pretty manners. Janey possessed the two first
faculties, but neither had nor apparently could acquire the third.
The two dark brown heads were close together as they
worked—Ursula's shining and neat, and carefully arranged,
Janey's rough with elf-locks; but they were more interesting
than Reginald, though he was so much better informed. As
for Johnnie, he lay extended on the rug, his head slightly raised
on his two hands, his book on a level with the rest of his person,
saying over his lesson to himself with moving lips. And now
and then, when the girls' whispered chatter was silent, the sound
of Reginald's pen scratching across the paper would fill up the
interval; it was a sound which filled them all with respect.</p>

<p>This peaceful domestic scene was broken in upon by the
entry of Mr. May. From the moment that he closed the hall-door
behind him, coming in, a little thrill ran through the
family party. The girls looked at each other when they heard
that sound, and Johnnie, without stopping his inward repetition,
shifted himself and his book adroitly, with the cleverness of
practice, to the side instead of the front of the fire. Reginald's
pen stopped its scratching, and he wheeled round on his chair
to give an appealing glance at his sisters.</p>

<p>“What is it now?” he said hurriedly. Every one knew that
when the door was closed like that it meant something like a
declaration of war. But they had not much time to wait and
wonder. Mr. May came in, pushing the door wide open before
him, and admitting a gust of chill air of the January night.
He looked at the peaceable domestic scene with a “humph”
of dissatisfaction, because there was nothing to find fault with,
which is as great a grievance as another when one is in the
mood for grievances. He had come in cross and out of sorts,
with a private cause for his ill-temper, which he did not choose
to reveal, and it would have been a relief to him had he found
them all chattering or wasting their time, instead of being
occupied in this perfectly dutiful way—even Johnnie at his
lessons, repeating them over under his breath. What was the
world coming to? Mr. May was disappointed. Instead of
leading up to it gradually by a general <i>battue</i> of his children
all round, he had to open upon his chief subject at once, which
was not nearly so agreeable a way.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, Reginald?” he asked, roughly, pulling
his chair to the other side of the fire, opposite the corner
to which Johnnie had scuffled out of the way. “I have come
in especially to speak to you. It is time this shilly-shallying
was done with. Do you mean to accept the College chaplaincy
or not? an answer must be given, and that at once. Are you
so busy that you can't attend to what I say?”</p>

<p>“I am not busy at all, sir,” said Reginald, in a subdued
voice, while his sisters cast sympathetic looks at him. Both
the girls, it is true, thought him extremely foolish, but what of
that? Necessarily they were on his side against papa.</p>

<p>“I thought as much; indeed it would be hard to say what
you could find to be busy at. But look here, this must come
to an end one way or another. You know my opinion on the
subject.”</p>

<p>“And you know mine, sir,” said Reginald, rising and coming
forward to the fire. “I don't say anything against the old
College. For an old man it might be quite a justifiable arrangement—one
who had already spent his strength in work—but
for me—of course there is nothing in the world to do.”</p>

<p>“And two hundred and fifty a year for the doing of it—not
to speak of the house, which you could let for fifty more.”</p>

<p>“Father! don't you see that is just the very thing that I
object to, so much for nothing.”</p>

<p>“You prefer nothing for nothing,” said Mr. May, with a
smile; “well, I suppose that is more fair, perhaps—to the
public;—but how about me? A son of three-and-twenty depending
upon me for everything, useless and bringing in
nothing, does not suit me. You are all the same,” he said,
“all taking from me, with a thousand wants, education, clothes,
amusement—”</p>

<p>“I am sure,” said the irrepressible Janey, “it is not much
clothes we get, and as for amusements—and education!”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue,” cried her father. “Here are six of
you, one more helpless than another, and the eldest the most
helpless of all. I did not force you into the Church. You
might have gone out to James if you had liked—but you chose
an academical career, and then there was nothing else for it.
I gave you a title to orders. You are my curate just now—so
called; but you know I can't pay a curate, and you know I
can't afford to keep you. Providence—” said Mr. May, sitting
up in his chair, with a certain solemnity, “Providence itself
has stepped in to make your path clear. Here is better than
a living, a provision for you. I don't bid you take it for life;
take it for a year or two till you can hear of something better.
Now what on earth is your objection to this?”</p>

<p>The girls had both turned their faces towards their brother.
Janey, always the first in action, repeated almost unconsciously.
“Yes, what on earth, Reginald, can be your objection to this?”</p>

<p>Reginald stood in the middle of the room and looked helplessly
at them. Against his father alone he might have made
a stand—but when the united family thus gazed at him with
inquiring and reproachful looks, what was he to say?</p>

<p>“Objection!” he faltered, “you know very well what my
objection is. It is not honest work—it is no work. It is a
waste of money that might be better employed; it is a sinecure.”</p>

<p>“And what do you call your nominal curateship,” said his
father, “is not that a sinecure too?”</p>

<p>“If it is,” said Reginald, growing red, but feeling bolder,
for here the family veered round, and placed itself on his side,
“it is of a contrary kind. It is <i>sine</i> pay. My work may be
bad, though I hope not, but my pay is nothing. I don't see
any resemblance between the two.”</p>

<p>“Your pay nothing!” cried the father, enraged; “what do
you call your living, your food that you are so fastidious about,
your floods of beer and all the rest of it—not to speak of tailors'
bills much heavier than mine?”</p>

<p>“Which are never paid.”</p>

<p>“Whose fault is it that they are never paid? yours and the
others who weigh me down to the ground, and never try to
help or do anything for themselves. Never paid! how should
I have gone on to this period and secured universal respect if
they had never been paid? I have had to pay for all of you,”
said Mr. May, bitterly, “and all your vagaries; education, till
I have been nearly ruined; dresses and ribbons, and a hundred
fooleries for these girls, who are of no use, who will never give
me back a farthing.”</p>

<p>“Papa!” cried Ursula and Janey in one breath.</p>

<p>“Hold your tongues! useless impedimenta, not even able to
scrub the floors, and make the beds, which is all you could ever
be good for—and you must have a servant forsooth to do even
that. But why should I speak of the girls?” he added, with
a sarcastic smile, “they can do nothing better, poor creatures;
but you! who call yourself a man—a University man, save the
mark—a fine fellow with the Oxford stamp upon you, twenty-three
your next birthday. It is a fine thing that I should still
have to support you.”</p>

<p>Reginald began to walk up and down the room, stung beyond
bearing—not that he had not heard it all before, but to get
accustomed to such taunts is difficult, and it is still more difficult
for a young and susceptible mind to contradict all that is
seemly and becoming in nature, and to put forth its own statement
in return. Reginald knew that his education had in
reality cost his father very little, and that his father knew this.
He was aware, too, much more distinctly than Mr. May knew,
of James's remittances on his account; but what could he say?
It was his father who insulted him, and the young man's lips
were closed; but the effort was a hard one. He could not
stand still there and face the man who had so little consideration
for his feelings. All he could do was to keep his agitation
and irritation down by that hurried promenade about the room,
listening as little as he could, and answering not at all.</p>

<p>“Oh, papa! how can you?” cried Janey, seizing the first
pause. Janey was not old enough to understand the delicacy
that closed Reginald's lips, and the impulse of self-defence was
stirring in her; “how dare you talk to Ursula so? I mayn't
be much use, but Ursula! nice and comfortable you were when
she was away! as if you didn't say so ten times in a morning;
to be sure that was to make me feel uncomfortable. Scrub
floors!” cried Janey, in the violence of her resentment. “I'll
go out and be a maid-of-all-work whenever you please. I am
sure it would be much happier than here.”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue,” said Mr. May, “you scolding and
Ursula crying; that's the beauty of the feminine element in a
house. I ought to be very thankful, oughtn't I, that I have
girls to furnish this agreeable variety? But as for you, Reginald,”
his father added, “mark my words, if you determine to
reject this windfall that Providence has blown into your hands,
it must be done at once. No further play of I would and I
would not, if you please, here; and if it does not suit you, you
will please to understand that I have no further need for a
curate that suits me still less. I want your room. If nothing
else can be done, I must try to take a pupil to add a little to
the income which has so many claims upon it; and I don't
mean to go on keeping you—this is plain enough, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Very plain, sir,” said Reginald, who had grown as pale as
he was red before.</p>

<p>“I am glad to hear it; you will write to the Corporation at
once, accepting or rejecting at your pleasure; but this must
be done to-night. I must insist on its being done to-night;
and if you find yourself sufficiently bold to reject an income,”
said Mr. May with emphasis, “and go off into the world without
a penny in your pocket, I wash my hands of it; it is
nothing to me.”</p>

<p>Then there was a pause. The father of the family sat down
in his chair, and looked round him with the happy consciousness
that he had made everybody miserable. The girls were
both crying, Reginald pale and desperate, coming and going
through the room. No one had escaped but Johnnie, who,
happy in insignificance, lay all his length on the other side of
the fire, and lifted his face from his book to watch the discomfiture
of the others. Johnnie had no terrors on his own account.
He had done nothing to call forth the paternal wrath. Mr.
May could not resist this temptation.</p>

<p>“Is that a way to learn lessons as they ought to be learnt?”
he cried suddenly, throwing one of his darts at the unthinking
boy. “Get up this moment, and sit down to a table somewhere.
Your own room, where there is nobody to disturb you,
is better than amid the chit-chat here; do you hear me? get
up, sir, and go.”</p>

<p>Johnnie stumbled to his feet appalled; he was too much
startled to say anything. He took his books across the room
to the writing-table which Reginald had abandoned in a similar
way. But by the time he reached that haven, he came to himself,
and recovering his courage muttered something about the
hardship to which he was thus exposed, as boys have a way of
doing; upon which Mr. May got suddenly up, seized him by
the shoulders and turned him out of the drawing-room. “I
said your own room, sir,” cried this impartial father, distributing
to all alike an equal share of his urbanities. When he had
accomplished this, he stood for a moment and looked at the
rest of his confused and uncomfortable family. “There is not
much cheerful society to be had here this evening, I perceive,”
he said. “It is pleasant to come in from one's cares and find
a reception like this, don't you think? Let some one bring me
some coffee to my study. I am going to write.”</p>

<p>“Whose fault is it that he gets such a reception?” burst
forth Janey, the moment her father had closed the door.
“Who does it all, I wonder? Who treats us like a set of
wretches without any feeling? I can't hush, I won't hush! Oh,
shouldn't I be glad to go out as a housemaid, to do anything!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Janey, hush! we can't help ourselves, we are obliged
to put up with it,” said Ursula; “but Reginald, he is not
obliged, he can save himself when he likes. Oh, I know, I
know papa is unreasonable; but, Reginald, aren't you a little
bit unreasonable too?”</p>

<p>“Don't you begin to reproach me,” cried the young man,
“I have had enough for one day. Have I been such a charge
upon him, Ursula? What has he spent upon me? Next to
nothing. That tailor's bill he spoke of, he knew as well as I
do that I paid it by the tutorship I had in the vacation. It is
his bill that is not paid, not mine. And then James's
money—”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind that, never mind the past,” cried Ursula,
“think of the present, that's what you ought to do. Oh,
Reginald, think; if <i>I</i> had the chance of two hundred and fifty
pounds a year! there is nothing I would not do for it. I
would scrub floors, as he said, I would do anything, the dirtiest
work. You will be independent, able to do what you please,
and never to ask papa for anything. Reginald, think! Oh,
dear, dear, I wish I knew how to talk to you. To be independent,
able to please yourself!”</p>

<p>“I shall be independent anyhow after to-night,” he said.
“Ursula, you will help me to pack my things, won't you? It
is leaving you here, you girls, with nobody to stand up for you;
it is that I feel most.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Reginald, don't go and leave us,” cried Janey, leaning
on the back of his chair; “what can we do without you?
When he comes in, in a rage like to-night, as long as you are
here one can bear it. Oh, Reginald, can't you, can't you take
the chaplaincy? Think what it would be for us.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will pack your things,” said Ursula, “I will help
you to get out of it, though we must stay and put up with it
all, and never, never escape. But where will you go? You
have no money, not enough scarcely to pay your railway fare.
You would have to take to teaching; and where are you to
go?”</p>

<p>“I have some friends left,” cried Reginald, his lips quivering,
“some people care for me still and would hold out a hand. I
am—not—quite so badly off as he thinks; I could go to town,
or to Oxford—or—”</p>

<p>“You don't know where; and here is a nice old-fashioned
house all ready for you to step into, and an income,” cried
Ursula, her tone deepening to mark the capital letter; “an
Income, quite sure and ready—without any difficulty, without
any trouble, all if you say yes. Oh, only think what a comfort
for us all to be able to rush to you when we are in trouble!
Think of Johnnie and Robin; and that delightful wainscoted
room for your study, with the book-cases all ready—and plenty
of money to buy books.” This being the highest point to which
Ursula could reach, she dropped down after it into an insinuating
half whisper, “And plenty of work to do; dear Reginald,
plenty of work in the parish, you may be sure, if you will only
help the Rector; or here where you are working already, and
where you may be sure nobody will think of paying you. Oh,
Reginald, there is plenty, plenty of work.”</p>

<p>The young man was already beginning to melt. “Do you
think so?” he said.</p>

<p>“Think!” cried Janey, “I am sure you may do all papa's
work for him and welcome, if that is all. For my part I think
you are very silly, both Ursula and you. Work! Pay is far
better if you weren't such a pair of simpletons. After all, he
has a little reason to be angry. Good gracious! why shouldn't
you take it? Some one else will, if you won't. I would in a
minute, and so would Ursula if we could. And why should
you be so much grander than anybody else? I think it is
quite childish for my part.”</p>

<p>“Reginald, never mind her, she is only a child and doesn't
understand ('Child yourself,' cried Janey). I don't understand
very well, but still I can see what you want. Oh, you
might find such quantities of work, things nobody is ever found
to do. What do the fellows do at Oxford that they get that
money for? I have heard you say you would be very glad to
get a fellowship—”</p>

<p>“That is different, that is a reward of scholarship.”</p>

<p>“Well, and so is this too,” said Ursula; “it is (I am sure)
because the old men knew you were one that would be kind.
You were always kind, Reginald, that is what it is for.”</p>

<p>“The old men have nothing to do with it,” he said, shaking
his head, “it is the Corporation, and they are—”</p>

<p>“Very rich men, Reginald dear, a great many of them, very
sensible! what does it matter about their education? And then
you would be a really educated man, always ready to do anything
that was wanted in Carlingford. Don't you see that was
their meaning? They pay you for that which is not work, but
they will find you plenty of work they don't pay for. That is
what they mean; and oh, Reginald, to run over to you there in
that pretty wainscoted room, and to have you coming in to us
every day, and to know that you were there to stand by us!”</p>

<p>Here once more Ursula began to cry. As for Janey, she
made a dash at the writing-table and brought him paper and
pens and ink, “Say yes, say yes,” she cried; “oh, Reginald, if
it was only to spite papa!”</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVI"/>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>THE NEW GENTLEMAN.</h3>


<p>It seems difficult to imagine what connection there could be
between Phœbe Beecham's appearance in Grange Lane and the
interview which took place there between her and the “new
gentleman,” and Mr. May's sudden onslaught upon his family,
which ended in Reginald's acceptance of the chaplaincy. But
yet the connection was very distinct. Not even the Mays, in
their excitement over the appearance of a stranger in Carlingford,
could be more surprised than Phœbe was when her solitary
walk was interrupted by the apparition across the street
of a known person, a face familiar to her in other regions.
“Mr. Northcote!” she cried, with a little start of surprise.
As for the stranger, he made but two steps across Grange Lane
in his delight at the sight of her. Not that he was Phœbe's
lover, or possessed by any previous enthusiasm for the girl
whom he had met about half-a-dozen times in his life, and of
whom he knew little more than that she was the daughter of a
“brother clergyman;” for both Mr. Beecham and he were in
the habit of using that word, whether appropriate or inappropriate.
This was the explanation of the white necktie and the
formal dress which had puzzled Ursula.</p>

<p>Horace Northcote was not of Mr. Beecham's class. He was
not well-to-do and genial, bent upon keeping up his congregation
and his popularity, and trying to ignore as much as he
could the social superiority of the Church without making
himself in any way offensive to her. He was a political Nonconformist,
a vigorous champion of the Disestablishment
Society, more successful on the platform than in the pulpit,
and strenuously of opinion in his heart of hearts that the
Church was the great drawback to all progress in England, an
incubus of which the nation would gladly be rid. His dress
was one of the signs of his character and meaning. Strong in
a sense of his own clerical position, he believed in uniform as
devoutly as any Ritualist, but he would not plagiarise the
Anglican livery and walk about in a modified soutane and
round hat like “our brethren in the Established Church,” as
Mr. Beecham kindly called them. To young Northcote they
were not brethren, but enemies, and though he smiled superior
at the folly which stigmatised an M.B. waistcoat, yet he scorned
to copy. Accordingly his frock coat was not long, but of the
extremest solemnity of cut and hue, his white tie was of the
stiffest, his tall hat of the most uncompromising character. He
would not veil for a day in easier and more ordinary habiliments
the distinct position he assumed as clerical, yet not of
the clergy; a teacher of men, though not a priest of the Anglican
inspiration. He could not help feeling that his appearance, as
he moved about the streets, was one which might well thrill
Anglican bosoms with a flutter of terror. He was the Church's
avowed enemy, and upon this he stood as his claim to the
honour of those who thought with him. This was very different
from the views held by the pastor of the Crescent Chapel, who
was very willing to be on the best terms with the Church, and
would have liked to glide into closer and closer amity, and perhaps
finally to melt away altogether in her broad bosom, like a
fat raindrop contributing noiselessly to swell the sea. It was
not, however, any feeling of this difference which made Phœbe
draw herself back instinctively after the first start of recognition.
Across her mind, even while she held out her hand to
the stranger, there flashed a sudden recollection of her grandmother
and her grandfather, and all the homely belongings which
he, a minister of the connection, could not be kept in ignorance
of. It was but a momentary pang. Phœbe was not so foolish
as to shrink before the inevitable, or to attempt by foolish expedients
to stave off such a danger. She shrank for a second,
then drew herself up and shook off all such ignoble cares. “I
am myself whatever happens,” was her reflection; and she said
with something like security:</p>

<p>“I am so glad to meet you, Mr. Northcote; what an unexpected
pleasure to see you here!”</p>

<p>“It is a most unexpected pleasure for me, I assure you,” he
said, “and a very great one.” He spoke with unaffected
honesty; for indeed his plunge into the society of Salem
Chapel had given him a shock not easily got over, and the appearance
of a being of his own species, among all these excellent
poulterers and grocers, was a relief unspeakable; and then he
added, “May I walk with you, if you are going to walk?”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said Phœbe with momentary hesitation, and it was
just at this moment that she perceived Ursula on the other
side of the road, and, glad of the diversion, waved her hand to
her, and said, “How do you do?”</p>

<p>“A friend of yours?” said Mr. Northcote, following her
gesture with his eyes, and feeling more and more glad that he
had met her. “I passed those young ladies just now, and
heard some of their conversation, which amused me. Do they
belong to our people? If you will not be angry, Miss
Beecham, I must say that I should be glad to meet somebody
belonging to us, who is not—who is more like—the people one
meets elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Phœbe, “we are always talking of wanting
something original; I think on the whole I am of your opinion;
still there is nothing very great or striking about most of the
people one meets anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Yes; society is flat enough,” said the young man. “But—it
is strange and rather painful, though perhaps it is wrong
to say so—why, I wonder, are all our people of one class?
Perhaps you have not seen much of them here? All of one
class, and that—”</p>

<p>“Not an attractive class,” said Phœbe, with a little sigh.
“Yes, I know.”</p>

<p>“Anything but an attractive class; not the so-called working
men and such like. One can get on with them. It is very unpleasant
to have to say it; buying and selling now as we have
it in Manchester does not contract the mind. I suppose we all
buy and sell more and less. How is it? When it is tea and
sugar—”</p>

<p>“Or butter and cheese,” said Phœbe with a laugh, which
she could not quite keep from embarrassment. “I must be
honest and tell you before you go any further. You don't
know that I belong to the Tozers, Mr. Northcote, who are in
that line of business. Don't look so dreadfully distressed. Perhaps
I shouldn't have told you, had you not been sure to find out.
Old Mr. Tozer is my grandfather, and I am staying there. It is
quite simple. Papa came to Carlingford when he was a young
clergyman, newly ordained. He was pastor at Salem Chapel,
and married mamma, who was the daughter of one of the chief
members. I did not know myself when I came to Carlingford
that they actually kept a shop, and I did not like it. Don't
apologize, please. It is a very difficult question,” said Phœbe
philosophically, partly to ease herself, partly to set him at his
ease, “what is best to do in such a case. To be educated in
another sphere and brought down to this, is hard. One cannot
feel the same for one's relations; and yet one's poor little bit
of education, one's petty manners, what are these to interfere
with blood relationships? And to keep everybody down to
the condition they were born, why, that is the old way—”</p>

<p>“Miss Beecham, I don't know what to say. I never meant—I
could not tell. There are excellent, most excellent people
in all classes.”</p>

<p>“Exactly so,” said Phœbe, with a laugh. “We all know
that; one man is as good as another—if not better. A butterman
is as good as a lord; but—” she added, with a little elevation
of her eyebrows and shrug of her shoulders, “not so
pleasant to be connected with. And you don't say anything
about my difficulty, Mr. Northcote. You don't realize it perhaps,
as I do. Which is best: for everybody to continue
in the position he was born in, or for an honest shopkeeper to
educate his children and push them up higher until they come
to feel themselves members of a different class, and to be
ashamed of him? Either way, you know, it is hard.”</p>

<p>Northcote was at his wit's end. He had no fellow-feeling
for this difficulty. His friends were all much better off than
he was as a poor minister. They were Manchester people, with
two or three generations of wealth behind them, relations of
whom nobody need be ashamed; and he was himself deeply
humiliated and distressed to have said anything which could
humiliate Phœbe, who rose immeasurably in his estimation in
consequence of her bold avowal, though he himself would have
sacrificed a great deal rather than put himself on the Tozer
level. He did not know what to say.</p>

<p>“Miss Beecham, you know as well as I do, how falsely our
opinions are formed in this respect, how conventional we are.
What is position after all? To a grand Seigneur, for instance,
the difference between his steward and his laquais seems nothing,
but to the steward it is a great gulf. I—I mean—the
whole question is conventional—position, or station, or rank—”</p>

<p>Phœbe smiled. “I don't think that is quite the question,”
she said, “but never mind. I suppose you are here on some
mission? You would not come to Carlingford for pleasure.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Northcote, with a reproachful tone. “I
should have thought you must have heard of our Meeting. It
is for to-night. I have come from the Disestablishment
Society with some other friends; but it has been my fate to
come on before to make the arrangements. The others come
to-day.”</p>

<p>“A hard fate, Mr. Northcote.”</p>

<p>“I thought so this morning. I have not been much in the
way of the country congregations. I was confounded; but,
Miss Beecham, I no longer think my fate hard since I have
met you. Your noble simplicity and frankness have taught
me a lesson.”</p>

<p>“It is not noble at all,” said Phœbe; “if I had not been sure
you must find out I should have said nothing about it. Now
I fear I must turn back.”</p>

<p>“But you will come to the Meeting,” he said, turning with
her. He felt it necessary to be obsequious to Phœbe, after the
terrible mistake he had made.</p>

<p>“Not unless grandpapa insists. I should like to hear your
speech,” said Phœbe; “but I don't object to the Established
Church as you do, neither does papa when you push him hard.
I don't think England would be much nicer if we were all Dissenters.
To be sure we might be more civil to each other.”</p>

<p>“If there were no Dissenters, you mean.”</p>

<p>“It comes to much the same thing; congregations are not
pleasant masters, are they, Mr. Northcote? I know some
people—one at least,” said Phœbe, “who is often very insolent
to papa; and we have to put up with it—for the sake of peace,
papa says. I don't think in the Church that any leading
member could be so insolent to a clergyman.”</p>

<p>“That is perhaps rather—forgive me—a narrow, personal
view.”</p>

<p>“Wait till you get a charge, and have to please the congregation
and the leading members!” cried Phœbe. “I know
what you are thinking: it is just like a woman to look at a
public question so. Very well; after all women are half the
world, and their opinion is as good as another.”</p>

<p>“I have the greatest respect for your opinion,” said young
Northcote; “but we must not think of individual grievances.
The system, with all its wrongs, is what occupies me. I have
heard something—even here—this very day—What is it, my
good friend? I am busy now—another time; or if you want
me, my lodgings are—”</p>

<p>A glance, half of pain, half of fun, came into Phœbe's eyes.
“It is grandpapa!” she said.</p>

<p>“You shouldn't speak in that tone, sir, not to your elders,
and maybe your betters,” said Tozer, in his greasy old coat.
“Ministers take a deal upon them; but an old member like
me, and one as has stood by the connection through thick and
thin, ain't the one to be called your good friend. Well, if you
begs pardon, of course there ain't no more to be said; and
if you know our Phœbe—Phœbe, junior, as I calls her. What
of the meeting, Mr. Northcote? I hope you'll give it them
Church folks 'ot and strong, sir. They do give themselves airs,
to be sure, in Carlingford. Most of our folks is timid, seeing
for one thing as their best customers belong to the Church.
That don't touch me, not now-a-days,” said Tozer, with a laugh,
“not that I was ever one as concealed my convictions. I hope
you'll give it 'em 'ot and strong.”</p>

<p>“I shall say what I think,” said the young man bewildered.
He was by no means broken into the ways of the connection,
and his pride rebelled at the idea of being schooled by this old
shopkeeper; but the sight of Phœbe standing by not only
checked his rebellious sentiments, but filled him with a sympathetic
thrill of feeling. What it must be for that girl to own
this old man, to live with him, and feel herself shut into his
society and friends of his choosing—to hear herself spoken of
as Phœbe, junior! The idea made him shiver, and this caught
old Tozer's always hospitable eye.</p>

<p>“You're chilly,” he said, “and I don't wonder after the
dreadful weather we've had. Few passes my door without a
bite or a sup, specially at tea-time, Mr. Nor'cote, which is
sociable time, as I always says. Come in and warm yourself
and have a cup of tea. There is nothing as pleases my old
woman so much as to get out her best tea-things for a minister;
she 'as a great respect for ministers, has Mrs. Tozer, sir;
and now she's got Phœbe to show off as well as the chiney.
Come along, sir, I can't take no refusal. It's just our time
for tea.”</p>

<p>Northcote made an unavailing attempt to get away, but
partly it appeared to him that to refuse the invitation might
look to Phœbe like a pretence of superiority on his part, and
partly he was interested in herself, and was very well aware he
should get no company so good in Carlingford, even with the
drawback of the old shop-people among whom she lived. How
strange it was to see her in the dress of which Mrs. Sam Hurst
had raved, and of which even the young Nonconformist vaguely
divined the excellence, putting her daintily-gloved hand upon
old Tozer's greasy sleeve, walking home with the shuffling old
man, about whose social position no one could make the least
mistake! He turned with them, with a sensation of thankfulness
that it was in Grange Lane, Carlingford, where nobody
knew him. As for Phœbe, no such comfort was in her mind;
everybody knew her here, or rather, everybody knew old Tozer.
No disguise was possible to her. The only way to redeem the
position was to carry it with a high hand, as she did, holding
her head erect, and playing her part so that all the world might
see and wonder. “I think you had better come, Mr. Northcote,
and have some tea,” she said graciously, when the awe-stricken
young man was floundering in efforts to excuse himself.
Old Tozer chuckled and rubbed his hands.</p>

<p>“Take Phœbe's advice,” he said, “Phœbe's the sensiblest
girl I know; so was her mother before her, as married one of
the most popular preachers in the connection, though I say it
as shouldn't. My old woman always said as our Phœbe was
cut out for a minister's wife. And Phœbe junior's just such
another,” cried the admiring grandfather. Heavens above!
did this mean traps and snares for himself, or did the old shopkeeper
think of him, Horace Northcote, as another possible
victim? If he had but known with what sincere compassionate
toleration Phœbe regarded him, as a young man whom she
might be kind to, he might have been saved all alarm on this
point. The idea that a small undistinguished Dissenting
minister should think her capable of marrying him, was a
humiliation which did not enter into Phœbe's head.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVII"/>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>A PUBLIC MEETING.</h3>


<p>Phœbe's philosophy, however, was put to the test when,
after the young pastor had taken tea and got himself away from
the pressing hospitalities of the Tozers, her grandfather also
disappeared to put on his best coat in order to attend the
Meeting. Mrs. Tozer, left alone with her granddaughter,
immediately proceeded to evolve her views as to what Phœbe
was expected to do.</p>

<p>“I never see you out o' that brown thing, Phœbe,” she said;
“ain't you got a silk dress, child, or something that looks a bit
younger-looking? I'd have thought your mother would have
took more pride in you. Surely you've got a silk dress.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, more than one,” said Phœbe, “but this is considered
in better taste.”</p>

<p>“Taste, whose taste?” cried the old lady; “my Phœbe
didn't ought to care for them dingy things, for I'm sure she
never got no such example from me. I've always liked what
was bright-looking, if it was only a print. A nice blue silk
now, or a bright green, is what you'd look pretty in with your
complexion. Go now, there's a dear, and put on something
very nice, something as will show a bit; you're going with
your grandfather to this Meeting.”</p>

<p>“To the Meeting? oh, I hope not,” said Phœbe with fervour.</p>

<p>“And why should you hope not? isn't it natural as a young
creature like you should get out a bit when she can, and see
what's to be seen? I don't hold with girls moping in a house.
Besides, it's very instructive, as I've always heard: and you as
is clever, of course you'll understand every word. Mr. Northcote
is a nicish-looking sort of young man. Ministers mayn't
be much,” said Mrs. Tozer, “though just see how your papa
has got on, my dear. Nobody else as Phœbe could have
married would have got up in the world like that; you may
make a deal more money in trade, but it ain't so genteel,
there's always that to be said. Now it's just as well as you
should have your chance with the rest and let yourself be seen,
Phœbe. Run, there's a darling, and put on something bright,
and a nice lace collar. You can have mine if you like. I
shouldn't grudge nothing, not a single thing I've got, to see
you looking as nice as the best there; and so you will if you
take a little pains. I'd do up my hair a bit higher if I was you;
why, Phœbe, I declare! you haven't got a single pad. Now
what is the use of neglecting yourself, and letting others get
ahead of you like that?”</p>

<p>“Pads are going out of fashion, grandmamma,” said
Phœbe gravely, “so are bright colours for dresses. You can't
think what funny shades we wear in town. But must I go to
this Meeting? I should not like to leave you alone. It is so
much nicer for me to be here.”</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i> a good girl, you are,” said Mrs. Tozer admiringly,
“and me as was frightened for a fine lady from London! But
Tozer would say as it was my doing. He would say as it
wasn't natural for a young creature; and, bless you, they'll all
be there in their best—that Pigeon and the others, and Mrs.
Tom. I just wish I could go too, to see you outshine 'em all,
which you'll do if you take pains. Take a little more pains
with your hair, Phœbe, mount it up a bit higher, and if you
want anything like a bit of lace or a brooch or that, just you
come to me. I should like Mrs. Tom to see you with that
brooch as she's always wanting for Minnie. Now why should
I give my brooch to Minnie? I don't see no reason for it, for
my part.”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, grandmamma,” said Phœbe, “you must wear
your brooches yourself, that is what I like a great deal better
than giving them either to Minnie or me.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but there ain't a many like you, my sweet,” cried the
old woman, wiping her eyes. “You're my Phœbe's own
daughter, but you're a touch above her, my darling, and us too,
that's what you are. Run now and dress, or I don't know
what Tozer will say to me. He's set his heart on showing you
off to-night.”</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Phœbe went away reluctantly. It is unnecessary
to say that her disinterestedness about her grandmother's
brooch was not perhaps so noble as it appeared on the outside.
The article in question was a kind of small warming-pan in a
very fine solid gold mount, set with large pink topazes, and enclosing
little wavy curls of hair, one from the head of each
young Tozer of the last generation. It was a piece of jewelry
very well known in Carlingford, and the panic which rose in
Phœbe's bosom when it was offered for her own personal adornment
is more easily imagined than described. She went upstairs
feeling that she had escaped, and took out a black silk
dress at which she looked lovingly.</p>

<p>“But grandmamma would think it was no better than this,”
she said to herself, and after much searchings of heart she
chose a costume of Venetian blue, one soft tint dying into
another like the lustre on a piece of old glass, which in her own
opinion was a great deal too good for the occasion. “Some one
will tread on it to a certainty, and the colours don't show in
candle-light; but I must try to please grandmamma,” she said
heroically. When it was put on with puffings of lace such as
Mrs. Tozer had never seen, and was entirely ignorant of the
value of, at the throat and sleeves, Phœbe wrapt a shawl round
her in something of the same dim gorgeous hue, covered with
embroidery, an Indian rarity which somebody had bestowed
upon Mrs. Beecham, and which no one had used or thought of
till Phœbe's artistic eye fell upon it. It was a great deal too
fine for Carlingford. An opera-cloak bought in Oxford Street
for a pound or two would have much more impressed the
assembly to which Phœbe was bound. Mrs. Tozer inspected
her when she went downstairs, with awe, yet dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>“I dare say as it's all very fine, and it ain't like other folks,
anybody can see; but I'd dress you different, my dear, if you
was in my hands,” said the old woman, walking round and
round her. As for Tozer, he too showed less admiration than
if he had known better.</p>

<p>“I got a fly, thinking as you'd have some fallal or other on
you; but, bless my heart, you could have walked in that gown,”
he said. So that Phœbe's toilette, which would have been
mightily admired in a London drawing-room, could not be said
to be a success. She was somewhat discouraged by this, notwithstanding
that she knew so very much better; and accordingly
set out in the fly with her grandfather in his best coat,
feeling, generally, in a depressed condition.</p>

<p>“It is clear that I must take to the pinks and blues to please
them,” she said to herself with a sigh. She could triumph over
the slight that might be shown to herself in consequence of her
relations; but those sneers at her dress went to Phœbe's
heart.</p>

<p>The Music Hall was full of a miscellaneous crowd when
Phœbe, following her grandfather, went in; and the seats
allotted to these important people were on the platform, where,
at least, Tozer's unacknowledged object of showing her off could
be amply gratified. This arrangement did not, on the whole,
displease Phœbe. Since she must be exhibited, it seemed
better, on the whole, to be exhibited there, than in a less distinguished
place; and all the speakers knew her, which was
something. She sat down with some complaisance, and let her
Indian scarf droop from her shoulders, and her pretty dress show
itself.</p>

<p>“I declare if that isn't Phœbe, junior,” said Mrs. Tom
audibly, in the middle of the hall, “making a show of herself;
but, Lord bless us, for all their grandeur, how she do dress, to
be sure. A bit of a rag of an old shawl, and a hat on! the
same as she wears every day. I've got more respect for them
as comes to instruct us than that.”</p>

<p>And, indeed, Mrs. Tom was resplendent in a red <i>sortie de
bal</i>, with a brooch almost as big as that envied one of Mrs.
Tozer's stuck into her gown, and a cap covered with flowers
upon her head. This was the usual fashion of the Salem ladies
on such rare occasions. The meeting of the Disestablishment
Society was to them what a ball is to worldly-minded persons
who frequent such vanities. The leading families came out <i>en
masse</i> to see and to be seen. It would be wrong to say that they
did not enter into all the arguments and recognise the intellectual
feast set before them; no doubt they did this just as well
as if they had come in their commonest attire; but still the
seriousness of the occasion was, no doubt, modified by being
thus made into a dissipation. The men were not so fine, perhaps,
because it is more difficult for men to be fine—but they
were all in their Sunday clothes; and the younger ones were
in full bloom of coloured satin cravats and fine waistcoats.
Some of them were almost as fine a sight as the ladies in their
ribbons and flowers.</p>

<p>“I suppose by the look of them this must be an influential
community—people of some pretensions,” said an obese elderly
minister, who had seated himself by Phœbe, and whose eyes
were dazzled by the display. “I never expected all this dress
in a quiet country place.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! they are people of much pretension,” said Phœbe
gravely.</p>

<p>And then the proceedings began. Old Mr. Green, the
grocer, whose son had married Maria Pigeon, and who had long
been retired from business, occupying a house in the country
and “driving his carriage,” was in the chair; and the proceedings
went on according to the routine of such assemblies, with
differing degrees of earnestness on the part of the speakers.
To most of these gentlemen it was the ordinary occupation of
their lives; and they made their hearers laugh at well-known
stories, and enjoyed their own wit, and elicited familiar cheers,
and made hits such as they had made for years on the same
subject, which was a comfortable <i>cheval de bataille</i>, not at all
exciting to themselves, though they were quite willing to excite
their audience, if that audience would allow itself to be excited.
Things jogged on thus for the first hour very pleasantly! the
Meeting was not excited, but it was amused and enjoyed itself.
It was an intellectual treat, as Pigeon said to Brown, and if
the younger people did not like it so well as they would have
liked a ball, the elder people liked it a great deal better, and
the hall rang with applause and with laughter as one speaker
succeeded another. It was pleasant to know how unstable
“the Church” was on her foundation; that aristocratical
Church which looked down upon Dissent, and of which the
poorest adherent gave himself airs much above Chapel folks;
and how much loftier a position the Nonconformist held, who
would have nothing to say to State support.</p>

<p>“For my part,” said one of the speakers, “I would rather
abandon my sacred calling to-morrow, or make tents as St.
Paul did in its exercise, than put on the gilded fetters of the
State, and pray or preach as an Archbishop told me; nay, as
a Cabinet Council of godless worldlings directed. There are
many good men among the clergy of the Church of England;
but they are slaves, my friends, nothing but slaves, dragged at
the chariot wheels of the State; ruled by a caste of hard-headed
lawyers; or binding themselves in the rotten robes of tradition.
It is we only who can dare to say that we are free!”</p>

<p>At this sentiment, the Meeting fairly shouted with applause
and delight and self-complacency; and the speaker, delighted
too, and tasting all the sweetness of success, gave place to the
next, and came and sat down by Phœbe, to whose society the
younger men were all very glad to escape.</p>

<p>“Miss Beecham, you are fashionably calm,” whispered the
orator, “you don't throw yourself, like the rest of us, into this
great agitation.”</p>

<p>“Have you a leading member?” whispered Phœbe back
again; “and does he never drag you at his chariot wheels?
Have you deacons that keep you up to the mark? Have you
people you must drink tea with when they ask you, or else
they throw up their sittings? I am thinking, of course, of
papa.”</p>

<p>“Have I deacons? Have I leading members? Miss
Beecham, you are cruel—”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Phœbe, settling herself in her chair. “Here
is somebody who is in dreadful earnest. Don't talk, Mr.
Northcote is going to speak.”</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that the Minister's daughter played her
<i>rôle</i> of fine lady and <i>bel esprit</i> very fairly in an atmosphere so
unlike the air that fine ladies breathe. Phœbe paid no more
attention to the discomfited man at her elbow. She gathered
up her shawl in her hand with a seeming careless movement,
and let it drop lightly across her knee, where the gold threads
in the embroidery caught the light; and she took off her hat,
which she had thought proper to wear to show her sense that
the Meeting was not an evening party; and prepared herself
to listen. Her complexion and her hair, and the gold threads
in the rich Indian work, thus blazed out together upon the
startled audience. Many of them were as much struck by this
as by the beginning of Mr. Northcote's speech, though it was
very different from the other speeches. The others had been
routine agitation, this was fiery conviction, crude, and jumping
at conclusions, but still an enthusiasm in its way. Mr. Northcote
approached his subject gradually, and his hearers, at first
disappointed by the absence of their familiar watch-words, were
dull, and bestowed their attention on Phœbe; but before he
had been speaking ten minutes Phœbe was forgotten even by
her uncle and aunt, the two people most interested in her. It
would be dangerous to repeat to a reader, probably quite uninterested
in the controversy, Mr. Northcote's speech, in which
he laid hold of some of those weak points which the Church, of
course, has in common with every other institution in the
world. Eloquence has a way of evaporating in print, even when
the report is immediate. But his peroration was one which
startled his hearers out of a calm abstract interest to all that
keen personal feeling which accompanies the narrative of facts
known to an audience, and affecting people within their own
locality.</p>

<p>“I have only been in this place three days,” said the speaker,
“but in that short time I have heard of one of the most flagrant
abuses which I have been indicating to you. There is in this
town, as you all know, an institution called the College; what
was its original object I do not know. Nests of idle pauperism,
genteelly veiled under such a name, do exist, I know, over
all the country; but it is at least probable that some educational
purpose was in the mind of the pious founder who established
it. The pious founder! how immense are the revenues, how
incalculable the means of doing good, which have been locked
up in uselessness, or worse than uselessness, by men who have
purchased a pass into the kingdom of heaven at the last
moment by such gifts, and become pious founders just before
they ceased to be miserable sinners! Whatever may have been
the original intention of the College, however, it is clear that
it was meant for something more than the pitiful use it is put
to now. This old foundation, ladies and gentlemen, which
might provide half the poor children in Carlingford with a
wholesome education, is devoted to the maintenance of six old
men, need I say Churchmen?” (here the speaker was interrupted
by mingled hisses and ironical “hear, hears”)—“and a chaplain
to say their prayers for them. Six old men: and one able-bodied
parson to say their prayers for them. What do you
think of this, my friends? I understand that this heavy and
onerous duty has been offered—not to some other mouldy old
gentleman, some decayed clergyman who might have ministered
in peace to the decayed old burghers without any interference
on my part: for a refuge for the aged and destitute has something
natural in it, even when it is a wrong appropriation of
public money. No, this would have been some faint approach
perhaps to justice, some right in wrong that would have closed
our mouths. But no! it is given to a young gentleman, able-bodied,
as I have said, who has appeared more than once in the
cricket-field with your victorious Eleven, who is fresh from
Oxford, and would no more condescend to consider himself on
a footing of equality with the humble person who addresses you,
than I would, having the use of my hands, accept a disgraceful
sinecure! Yes, my friends, this is what the State Church does.
She so cows the spirit and weakens the hearts of her followers
that a young man at the very beginning of his career, able to
teach, able to work, able to dig, educated and trained and cultured,
can stoop to accept a good income in such a position as
this. Think of it! Six old men, able surely, if they are good
for anything, to mumble their prayers for themselves somehow;
yet provided with an Oxford scholar, an able-bodied young
man, to read the service for them daily! He thinks it very
fine, no doubt, a good income and a good house for life, and
nothing to do but to canter over morning and evening prayer
at a swinging pace, as we have all heard it done: morning
prayer, let us see, half an hour—or you may throw in ten
minutes, in case the six should mumble their Amens slowly—and
twenty minutes for the evening, one hour a day. Here it
is under your very eyes, people of Carlingford, a charming provision
for the son of one of your most respected clergymen.
Why, it is in your newspaper, where I read it! Can I give a
more forcible instance of the way in which a State Church cuts
honesty and honour out of men's hearts.”</p>

<p>A great many people noticed that when Mr. Northcote
ended this with a thundering voice, some one who had been
listening near the door in an Inverness cape, and hat over his
brows, gave himself a sudden impetuous shake which shook the
crowd, and turning round made his way out, not caring whom
he stumbled against. The whole assembly was in a hubbub
when the orator ceased, and whispers ran freely round among
all the groups in the front. “That's young May he means.”
“In course it's young May. Infernal job, as I've always said.”
“Oh hush, Pigeon, don't swear! but it do seem a black burning
shame, don't it?” “Bravo, Mr. Nor'cote!” called out old
Tozer, on the platform, “that's what I call giving forth no uncertain
sound. That's laying it into them 'ot and 'ot.”</p>

<p>This was the climax of the Meeting. Everything else was
flat after such a decided appeal to personal knowledge. Phœbe
alone gave a frigid reception to the hero of the evening.</p>

<p>“I dislike personalities,” she said, pointedly. “They never
do a cause any good; and it isn't gentlemanly; don't you think
so, Mr. Sloely;” and she turned away from Northcote, who
had come to speak to her, and devoted herself to the man at
her elbow, whom she had snubbed a little while before. Mr.
Northcote said to himself that this was untrue, and brought
up a hundred very good reasons why he should have employed
such an example, but the reproof stung him to the quick, for
to be ungentlemanly was the reproach of all others most calculated
to go to his heart.</p>

<p>But nobody knew how Mr. May went home in his Inverness
cape, breathing fire and flame, nor of the execution he did
thereupon.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XVIII"/>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>MR. MAY'S AFFAIRS.</h3>


<p>Mr. May went into his study and closed the door. He
poked the fire—he put himself into his easy-chair—he drew
his writing-book towards him, and opened it at where a half-written
sheet lay waiting. And then he paused, rubbed his
hands softly together, and falling back again, laughed quietly
to himself.</p>

<p>Yes; he who had stormed out of the drawing-room like a
whirlwind, having discomfited everybody, leaving the girls in
tears, and the boys in a white heat of passion, when he reached
the profoundest depths of his own retirement, laughed. What
did it mean? Of all the people in the world, his children
would have been most entirely thunderstruck by this self-betrayal.
They could not have understood it. They were
acquainted with his passions, and with his moments of good
temper. They knew when he was amiable, and when he was
angry, by instinct, by the gleam of his eye, by the way in which
he shut the door; but this was something totally unknown to
them. The truth was that Mr. May, like many other people,
having a naturally bad temper, which he indulged freely when
he pleased, had attained the power of using it when it suited
him to use it, without being suspected by anybody. A bad
temper is a possession like another, and may be made skilful
use of like other things which, perhaps, in themselves, are not
desirable. He could work himself up into fury, and launch the
doom he felt disposed to launch, like a burning and fizzing
thunder-bolt from a hand which was, in reality, not at all
excited; and like most other people who possess such an unrevealed
power, it pleased him very much when he persuaded
his surroundings that it was an impulse of rage which moved
him. He had been at the Meeting at the Music Hall, “to hear
what those fellows had to say for themselves.” Contempt,
unbounded but wrathful, was the feeling in his mind towards
“those fellows;” but he felt that young Northcote's eloquence,
reported in next day's papers, was quite enough to quash for
ever all hopes of his son's acceptance of the chaplaincy. So he
walked home as fast as his legs would carry him, and burst into
his house, as we have seen, with a semblance of passion so perfect
as to deceive his entire family and fill the place with anger
and tears. Upon which, withdrawing from the scene of conflict,
he threw himself down in his easy-chair and chuckled, recovering
his composure by slow degrees.</p>

<p>When, however, this private indulgence was over, Mr. May's
face grew dark enough. He pushed his writing away from
him, and pulling out a drawer in his writing-table, which was
full of papers of a very unliterary aspect, betook himself to the
consideration of them, with anything but laughter in his looks,
or in his mind. Letters upon blue paper in straight up and
down handwriting—other papers, also blue, with ruled lines
and numerals, for which Mr. May was more frightened than he
would have been for a charge of cavalry. These were the very
unattractive contents of this drawer. He brought two or three
of them out in a bundle and read them over, one after another,
with contracted brows. Debt is an idiosyncrasy like other
things. Some people keep clear of it miraculously, some seem
to drop into it without cause or meaning, and to spend all their
lives afterwards in vain attempts to get out. Mr. May was one
of these unfortunate men. He could not tell himself where his
money went to. Poor man! it was not so much he had, and
there was a large family to be fed and clothed, and schooled
after a sort. But still other people on incomes as small as his
had managed to maintain their families without dropping into
this hopeless condition. He had been in debt since ever he
could remember; and to be sure it was not the pain and
trouble to him that it is to many people. So long as, by hook
or by crook, he could manage to stave off the evil day, so long
was he happy enough, and he had managed this by all sorts of
semi-miraculous windfalls up to the present time. James's remittances
had been like heavenly dew to him. It is true that
these remittances had been intended to keep Reginald at
Oxford, and perhaps something of the special hardness with
which he regarded Reginald arose from the fact that he had
done him wrong in this respect, and had appropriated what was
intended for him. But after all, he had said to himself, the
maintenance of the house in comfort, the keeping clean of the
family name, and the staving off disagreeable revelations of the
family's poverty, were more, for even Reginald's comfort, than
a little more money in his pocket, which everybody knew was
very dangerous for a young man.</p>

<p>Mr. May had always a bill coming due, which James's remittances
arrived just in time to meet. Indeed, this was the
normal condition of his life. He had always a bill coming due—a
bill which some good-humoured banker had to be coaxed
into renewing, or which was paid at the last moment by some
skilful legerdemain in the way of pouring out of one vessel
into another, transferring the debt from one quarter to another,
so that there may have been said to be always a certain amount
of quite fictitious and visionary money floating about Mr. May,
money which existed only in the shape of symbol, and which,
indeed, belonged to nobody—which was borrowed here to-day,
and paid there to-morrow, to be re-borrowed and repaid in the
same way, never really reaching anybody's pocket, or representing
anything but that one thing which money is supposed to be
able to extinguish—debt. When human affairs reach this very
delicate point, and there is nothing at any moment, except a
semi-miraculous windfall, to keep a man going, the crisis is very
serious. And it was no wonder that Mr. May was anxious to
drive his son into accepting any possible appointment, and that
he occasionally railed unreasonably at his family. Unless a
hundred pounds or so fell down from the skies within the next
ten days, he saw nothing before him but ruin. This, it is needless
to say, is very far from being a comfortable position. The
<i>sourde</i> agitation, excitement, feverish hope and fear of the
sufferer might well affect his temper. If he could not get a
hundred pounds within ten days, he did not know what he
was to do.</p>

<p>And nobody could say (he thought to himself) that he was
an expensive man; he had no expensive habits. He liked good
living, it is true, and a glass of good wine, but this amount of
regard for the table does not ruin men. He liked books also,
but he did not buy them, contenting himself with such as the
library could afford, and those which he could obtain by the
reviews he wrote for the Church Magazines. How then was it
that he never could get rid of that rapidly maturing bill? He
could not tell. Keeping out of debt is one thing, and getting
rid of it when you have once taken its yoke upon your neck is
another. His money, when he had any, “slipped through his
fingers,” as people say. When James's remittance or any other
piece of good fortune gave him enough to pay that hundred
pounds without borrowing elsewhere, he borrowed elsewhere
all the same. It was a mysterious fatality, from which he
seemed unable to escape. In such circumstances a crisis must
come sooner or later, and it appeared to him that now at least,
after many hairbreadth escapes, the crisis had come.</p>

<p>What was he to do? There was no chance, alas! of money
from James, and even if Reginald accepted the chaplaincy, and
was willing at once to come to his father's aid, there was no
hope that he would have anything for some time—for chaplains
incomes are not, any more than other people's, generally paid
in advance. He leaned back in his chair and went over again,
for the hundredth time, the list of all the people he could borrow
from, or who would “back” a bill for him, and he was still
employed in this melancholy and hopeless enumeration, when
a low knock came to the door, and a maid-of-all-work, pushing
it open, thrust in a homely little man in a dusty-brown coat,
who put up a hand to his forehead as he came in with a salutation
which was half charity school-boy, half awkward recruit.
Beyond this there was no ceremony about his entrance, no
leave asked or question made. Betsy knew very well that he
was to come in when he pleased, and that her master did not
deny himself to Cotsdean. Mr. May received him with a
familiar nod, and pointed hastily to a chair. He did not even
take the trouble to put away those blue papers, which he would
have done if any other individual, even if one of his children
had come into the room.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Cotsdean,” he said, in a friendly tone.
“Well, what news?”</p>

<p>“Nothing as is pleasant, sir,” said the man, sitting down on
a corner of his chair. “I've been to the bank, and it's no use
my explaining, or begging ever so hard. They won't hear of
it. 'We've done it times and times,' they says to me, 'and
we won't do it no more. That's flat,' and so indeed it is flat,
sir, as you may say downright Dunstable; but that ain't no
advantage to you and me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is, Cotsdean,” said the clergyman, “it is a decided
advantage, for it shows there is nothing to be hoped from that
quarter, and that is always good—even though it's bad bad, as
bad as can be—”</p>

<p>“You may say so, sir,” said Cotsdean. “I don't know
what's to be done no more than the babe unborn, and it's wearing
me to death, that's what it's doing. When I looks round
on my small family, it's all I can do not to cry out loud.
What's to become of my children, Mr. May? Yours, sir,
they'll never want friends, and a hundred or so here or there,
that don't ruin gentlefolks; but without selling up the business,
how am I ever to get a hundred pounds? It ain't equal,
sir, I swear it ain't. You gets the money, and you takes it
easy, and don't hold your head not a bit lower; but me as has
no good of it (except in the way o' a bit of custom that is a
deal more in looks than anything else), and has to go round to
all the folks, to Mr. Brownlow, at the bank, and I don't know
who, as if it was for me! I suffers in my credit, sir, and I
suffers in my spirits, and I suffers in my health; and when the
smash comes, what's to become of my poor children? It's
enough to put a man beside himself, that's what it is.”</p>

<p>Here the poor man's eyes grew bloodshot, partly with rubbing
them, partly with tears. He rubbed them with the sleeve
of his rough coat, and the tears were very real, though few in
number. Cotsdean's despair was indeed tragical enough, but
its outside had in it a dash of comedy, which, though he was in
no mirthful mood, caught the quick eye of Mr. May. He was
himself very painfully affected, to tell the truth, but yet it cost
him an effort not to smile.</p>

<p>“Cotsdean,” he said, “have I ever failed you yet? You
have done a good deal for me, I don't deny it—you have had
all the trouble, but beyond that what have you suffered except
in imagination? If you choose to exaggerate dangers, it is not
my fault. Your children are as safe as—as safe as the Bank
of England. Now, have I ever failed you? answer me that.”</p>

<p>“I can't say as you have, sir,” said Cotsdean, “but it's dreadful
work playing with a man's ruin, off and on like this, and
nobody knowing what might happen, or what a day or an hour
might bring forth.”</p>

<p>“That is very true,” said Mr. May. “I might die, that is
what you mean; very true, though not quite so kind as I might
have expected from an old friend—a very old friend.”</p>

<p>“I am sure, Sir, I beg your pardon,” cried the poor man, “it
wasn't that; but only just as I'm driven out o' my seven senses
with thinking and thinking.”</p>

<p>“My dear Cotsdean, don't think; there could not be a more
unnecessary exercise; what good does your thinking do, but to
make you unhappy? leave that to me. We have been driven
into a corner before now, but nothing has ever happened to us.
You will see something will turn up this time. I ask you again,
have I ever failed you? you know best.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Cotsdean, somewhat doubtfully. “No, I
didn't say as you had. It's only—I suppose I ain't so young
as I once was—and a man's feelin's, sir, ain't always in his own
control.”</p>

<p>“You must take care that it is only to me that you make
such an exhibition as this,” said Mr. May. “Who is there?
oh, my coffee! put it on the table. If you are seen coming
here to me with red eyes and this agitated appearance,” he
went on, waiting pointedly till the door was closed, “it will be
supposed there is some family reason for it—again—”</p>

<p>“Oh, lor', Sir! you know—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know very well,” said the clergyman. “I know
that there couldn't be a better wife, and that bygones are bygones;
but you must remember and take care; everybody
doesn't know you—and her—so well as I do. When you come
to see your clergyman in this agitated state, I put it to yourself,
Cotsdean, I put it to your good sense, what is anybody to
think? You must take great care not to betray yourself to anybody
but me.”</p>

<p>The man looked at him with a half-gasp of consternation,
bewildered by the very boldness with which he was thus set
down. Betray himself—he drew a long breath, as if he had
received a <i>douche</i> of cold water in his face, which was indeed very
much like the effect that this extraordinary address produced—betray
himself! Poor Cotsdean's struggles and sufferings
arose, at the present moment, entirely from the fact that he
had allowed himself to be made use of for Mr. May's occasions,
and both the men were perfectly aware of this. But though
he gasped, Cotsdean was too much under the influence of his
clergyman to do anything more. Had he been a Dissenter, he
would have patronized young Northcote, who was as good a
man as Mr. May (or far better if truth were told), with the
frankest certainty of his own superior position, but being a
humble churchman he yielded to his clergyman as to one of the
powers that be. It is a curious difference. He sat still on the
edge of his chair, while Mr. May walked across the room to the
table by the door, where his <i>café noir</i> had been placed, and took
his cup and drank it. He was not civil enough to ask his
visitor to share it, indeed it never would have occurred to him,
though he did not hesitate to use poor Cotsdean for his own
purpose, to treat him otherwise than as men treat their servants
and inferiors. When he had finished his coffee, he went
leisurely back into his former place.</p>

<p>“You have nothing to suggest,” he said, “nothing to advise?
Well, I must try what I can do. It will be hard work, but
still I must do it, you know,” added Mr. May, in a gracious
tone. “I have never concealed from you, Cotsdean, how much
I appreciated your assistance; everything of this sort is so
much worse in my position than in yours. You understand
that? A gentleman—and a clergyman—has things expected
from him which never would be thought of in your case. I
have never omitted to acknowledge my obligations to you—and
you also owe some obligations to me.”</p>

<p>“I don't deny as you've been very kind, sir,” said Cotsdean,
half-grateful, half-sullen; then he wavered a little. “I never
denied it, <i>her</i> and me could never have 'it it off but for you. I
don't forget a favour—nobody can say that of me. I ain't forgot
it in this case.”</p>

<p>“I don't say that you have forgotten it. I have always put
the utmost confidence in you; but, my good fellow, you must
not come to me in this down-in-the-mouth way. Have I ever
failed you? We've been hard pressed enough at times, but
something has always turned up. Have not I told you a
hundred times Providence will provide?”</p>

<p>“If you put it like that, sir—”</p>

<p>“I do put it like that. I have always been helped, you
know, sometimes when it seemed the last moment. Leave it to
me. I have no more doubt,” said Mr. May, lifting up a countenance
which was by no means so untroubled as could have been
wished, “that when the time comes all will be well, than I
have of the sun rising to-morrow—which it will,” he added
with some solemnity, “whether you and I live to see it or not.
Leave it all, I say, to me.”</p>

<p>Cotsdean did not make any reply. He was overawed by
this solemnity of tone, and knew his place too well to set himself
up against his clergyman; but still it cannot be denied that
the decision was less satisfactory than one of much less exalted
tone might have been. He had not the courage to say anything—he
withdrew with his hat in his hand, and a cloud over his
face. But as he left the house the doubt in his soul breathed
itself forth. “If so be as neither me nor him see it rise, what
good will that do to my family,” said Cotsdean to himself, and
went his way to his closed shop, through all the sacks of seeds
and dry rustling grain, with a heavy heart. He was a corn-factor
in a tolerable business, which, as most of the bankers of Carlingford
knew, he had some difficulty in carrying along, being
generally in want of money; but this was not so rare a circumstance
that any special notice should be taken of it. Everybody
who knew thought it was very kind of Mr. May to back
him up as he did, and even to put his name to bills for poor
Cotsdean, to whom, indeed, he was known to have been very
kind in many ways. But nobody was aware how little of these
said bills went to Cotsdean, and how much to Mr. May.</p>

<p>When he was gone, the clergyman threw himself back again
into his chair with a pale face. Providence, which he treated
like some sort of neutral deity, and was so very sure of having
on his side when he spoke to Cotsdean, did not feel so near to
him, or so much under his command, when Cotsdean was gone.
There were still two days; but if before that he could not make
some provision, what was to be done? He was not a cruel or
bad man, and would have suffered keenly had anything happened
to poor Cotsdean and his family on his account. But they
must be sacrificed if it came to that, and the thought was very
appalling. What was he to do? His friends were exhausted,
and so were his expedients. There was no longer any one he
could borrow from, or who would take even a share of his
burden on their shoulders. What was he to do?</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XIX"/>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>THE NEW CHAPLAIN.</h3>


<p>It cannot be denied that, reluctant as Reginald May had
been to accept the chaplaincy of which so much had been said,
he had no sooner fairly done so, and committed himself beyond
remedy, than a certain sense of relief began to steal over the
young man's mind. He had made the leap. Moved, at last, by
arguments which, perhaps, were not worth very much logically,
and which even while he yielded to them he saw the weakness
of, he felt sure that when he woke in the morning, and realized
what he had done, fearful feelings of remorse would seize him.
But, curiously enough, this was not so; and his first sensation
was relief that the conflict was over, and that he had no more
angry remonstrances to meet with, or soft pleadings from
Ursula, or assaults of rude abruptness from Janey. All that
was over; and then a warm glow of independence and competency
came over the young man. You may be sure he had
no fire in his rooms to make him warm, and it was a chill
January morning, with snow in the heavy sky, and fog in the
yellow air; but, notwithstanding, there came a glow of comfort
over him.</p>

<p>Independent!—free to go where he pleased, buy what
he liked, spend his time as best seemed to him, with a
“position” of his own; even a house of his own. He laughed
softly to himself at this new idea. It did not somehow hurt
him as he thought it would, this sinecure he had accepted.
Could he not make it up, as Ursula said, “work for the town
in other ways without pay, since the town had given him pay
without work?” A genial feeling of toleration came over
Reginald's mind. Why should he have made such a fuss about
it? It was natural that his father should insist, and, now that
it was done, he himself did not wish it undone, as he had
expected to do. After all, if you judged matters with such
rigidity, who was there without guilt? what public appointment
was given and held according to abstract right, as, formally
speaking, it ought to be? Those in the highest offices were
appointed, not because of their personal excellence, but because
of being some other man's son or brother; and yet, on the
whole, public duty was well done, and the unjust ruler and
hireling priest were exceptions. Even men whose entry into
the fold was very precipitate, over the wall, violently, or by some
rat-hole of private interest, made very good shepherds, once
they were inside. Nothing was perfect in this world, and yet
things were more good than evil; and if he himself made it his
study to create for himself an ideal position, to become a doer
of all kinds of volunteer work, what would it matter that his
appointment was not an ideal appointment? It seemed very
strange to him, and almost like an interposition of Providence
in his favour, that he should feel in this way, for Reginald was
not aware that such revulsions of feeling were very natural
phenomena, and that the sensation, after any great decision, is
almost invariably one of relief. To be sure it upset this manly
state of mind a little when, coming down to breakfast, his father
gave him a nod, and said briefly, “I am glad you have seen
your duty at last.”</p>

<p>This made him almost resolve to throw it up again; but the
feeling was momentary. Why should he give it up? It had
made him independent (already he thought of his independence
as a thing accomplished), and he would make full amends to the
Church and to Carlingford for taking two hundred and fifty
pounds a year without working for it. Surely he could do that.
He did not grudge work, but rather liked it, and would be
ready to do anything, he did not care what, to make his sinecure
into a volunteer's outpost for every good work. Yes, that was
the way to look at it. And it was a glorious independence.
Two hundred and fifty pounds a year!</p>

<p>“And the house,” cried Ursula, when Mr. May had left the
breakfast-table, and left them free to chatter. “The house—I
don't think you are likely to find a tenant for it. The houses
in Grange Lane are so cheap now; and some people object to
the poor old men. I think you must keep the house. Furnishing
will be an expense; but, of course, when you have a certain
income, that makes such a difference; and you can come and
see us every day.”</p>

<p>“Why can't he live at home?” said Janey; “we are so poor;
he ought to come and pay us something for his board, and help
us to get on.”</p>

<p>“What can you know about it, at your age?” said Ursula.
“We have not got proper rooms for Reginald. He ought, at
least, to have a study of his own, as well as a bed-room, now
that he has an appointment. No, you must go to the College,
Reginald; and, perhaps, you might have one of the boys with
you, say Johnnie, which would be a great saving—for he has
an appetite; he eats more than two of the rest of us do. You
might take one of them with you—to save the bills a little—if
you like.”</p>

<p>“Take me,” said Janey, “I have a good appetite too; and
then I'm a girl, which is a great deal more useful. I could
keep your house. Oh, Reginald! mayn't we go out and see it?
I want to see it. I have never once been over the College—not
in all my life.”</p>

<p>“We might as well go, don't you think, Ursula?” he said,
appealing to her with a delightful mixture of helplessness and
supremacy. Yesterday, he had not been able to assert any
exclusive claim to sixpence. Now he had a house—a house all
his own. It pleased him to think of taking the girls to it;
and as for having one of them, he was ready to have them all
to live with him. Ursula thought fit to accede graciously to
this suggestion, when she had looked after her numerous household
duties. Janey, in the mean time, had been “practising”
in one of her periodical fits of diligence.</p>

<p>“For, you know, if Reginald did really want me to keep
house for him,” said Janey, “(you have too much to do at
home; or, of course, he would like you best), it would be
dreadful if people found out how little I know.”</p>

<p>“You ought to go to school,” said Ursula, gravely. “It is
a dreadful thing for a girl never to have had any education.
Perhaps Reggie might spare a little money to send you to
school; or, perhaps, papa—”</p>

<p>“School yourself!” retorted Janey, indignant; but then she
thought better of it. “Perhaps just for a year to finish,” she
added in a doubtful tone. They thought Reginald could do
anything on that wonderful two hundred and fifty pounds a
year.</p>

<p>The College was a picturesque old building at the other side
of Carlingford, standing in pretty grounds with some fine trees,
under which the old men sat and amused themselves in the
summer mornings. On this chilly wintry day none of them
were visible, except the cheerful old soul bent almost double,
but with a chirruppy little voice like a superannuated sparrow,
who acted as porter, and closed the big gates every night, and
fined the old men twopence if they were too late. He trotted
along the echoing passages, with his keys jingling, to show
them the chaplain's rooms.</p>

<p>
“The old gentlemen is all as pleased as Punch,” said Joe.
“We was a feared as it might be somebody foreign—not a
Carlingford gentleman; and some parsons is queer, saving
your presence, Mr. May; but we knows where you comes
from, and all about you, as one of the old gentlemen was just
a-saying to me. Furnished, Miss? Lord bless you, yes!
they're furnished. It's all furnished, is College. You'll think
as the things look a bit queer; they wasn't made not this year,
nor yet last year, I can tell you; and they ain't in the fashion.
But if so be as you don't stand by fashion, there they is,” said
Joe, throwing open the door.</p>

<p>The young people went in softly, their excitement subdued
into a kind of awe. An empty house, furnished, is more desolate,
more overwhelming to the imagination, than a house which
is bare. For whom was it waiting, all ready there, swept and
garnished? Or were there already unseen inhabitants about,
writing ghostly letters on the tables, seated on the chairs?
Even Janey was hushed.</p>

<p>“I'd rather stay at home, after all,” she whispered in Ursula's
ear under her breath.</p>

<p>But after awhile they became familiar with the silent
place, and awoke the echoes in it with their voices and new life.
Nothing so young had been in the College for years. The last
chaplain had been an old man and an old bachelor; and the
pensioners were all solitary, living a sort of monastic life, each
in his room, like workers in their cells. When Janey, surprised
by some unexpected joke, burst into one of her peals of
laughter, the old building echoed all through it, and more than
one window was put up and head projected to know the cause
of this profanation.</p>

<p>“Joe!” cried one portentous voice; “what's happened?
what's the meaning of this?”</p>

<p>“It's only them a-laughing, sir,” said Joe, delighting in the
vagueness of his rejoinder. “They ain't used to it, that's the
truth; but laugh away, Miss, it'll do you good,” he added
benignly. Joe was of a cheerful spirit, notwithstanding his
infirmities, and he foresaw lightsome days.</p>

<p>Somewhat taken aback, however, by the commotion produced
by Janey's laugh, the young party left the College, Ursula
carrying with her sundry memoranda and measurements for
curtains and carpets. “You must have curtains,” she said,
“and I think a carpet for the study. The other room will do;
but the study is cold, it has not the sunshine. I wonder if we
might go and look at some, all at once.”</p>

<p>Here the three paused in the road, and looked at each other
somewhat overcome by the grandeur of the idea. Even Reginald,
notwithstanding his Oxford experience, held his breath a
little at the thought of going right off without further consideration,
and buying carpets and curtains. As for Janey, she
laughed again in pure excitement and delight.</p>

<p>“Fancy going into Holden's, walking right in, as if we had
the Bank in our pockets, and ordering whatever we like,” she
cried.</p>

<p>“I suppose we must have them!” said Reginald, yielding
slowly to the pleasure of acquisition. Ursula was transformed
by the instinct of business and management into the leader of
the party.</p>

<p>“Of course you must have them,” she said, with the air of a
woman who had ordered curtains all her life, “otherwise you
will catch cold, and that is not desirable,” and she marched
calmly towards Holden's, while Janey dropped behind to
smother the laughter which expressed her amazed delight in
this new situation. It is doubtful whether Holden would have
given them so good a reception had the Miss Mays gone to hint
to order curtains for the Parsonage—for the Carlingford tradesmen
were very well aware of the difficulties, in point of payment,
which attended Mr. May's purchases. But Holden was
all smiles at the idea of fitting up the rooms in the College.</p>

<p>“Carpets? I have a Turkey carpet that would just suit
one of those old rooms—old-fashioned rooms are so much
thought of at present,” said the man of furniture.</p>

<p>“Yes—I suppose that would do,” said Reginald, with a side
look at his sister, to know if he was right. Ursula slew him
with a glance of her brown eyes. She was almost grand in
superior knowledge and righteous indignation.</p>

<p>“Turkey! are you out of your senses? Do you think we
have the Bank in our pockets,” she whispered to him angrily,
“as Janey says?”</p>

<p>“How was I to know? He said so,” said the alarmed
chaplain, cowed, notwithstanding his income.</p>

<p>“<i>He</i> said so! that is just like you boys, taking whatever
everyone tells you. Why, a Turkey carpet costs a fortune.
Mr. Holden, I think, if you please, Brussels will do; or some
of those new kinds, a jumble of colours without any decided
pattern. Not too expensive,” said Ursula solemnly, the colour
mounting to her face. They were all rather brought down
from their first delight and grandeur when this was said—for
stipulating about expense made a difference all at once. The
delightful sensation of marching into Holden's as if the world
belonged to them was over; but Janey was touched to see that
Holden still remained civil, and did not express, in his countenance,
the contempt he must have felt.</p>

<p>When this was over, and Mr. Holden had kindly suggested
the idea of sending various stuffs to the College, “that they
might judge of the effect,” the party went home, slightly subdued.
The air was heavy and yellow, and prophesied snow;
but a very red wintry sun had managed to make an opening
temporarily in the clouds, and threw a ruddy ray down Grange
Lane, bringing out the few passengers who were coming and
going under the old garden walls. Ursula clasped her hands
together, and came to a stop suddenly, when she turned her
eyes that way.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she said, “here she is—she is coming! all by herself,
and we can't help meeting her—the young lady in black!”</p>

<p>“Shall we speak to her?” said Janey with a little awe.</p>

<p>“Who is the young lady in black?” said Reginald, “this
girl who is coming up? I never saw her before in Carlingford.
Is she some one you have met with the Dorsets? She
don't look much like Grange Lane.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush! here she is,” said Ursula, losing all that importance
of aspect which her position as leader of the expedition
had given her. A pretty blush of expectation came over her
face—her dimples revealed themselves as if by magic. You
will think it strange, perhaps, that the sight of one girl should
produce this effect upon another. But then Phœbe represented
to Ursula the only glimpse she had ever had into a world which
looked gay and splendid to the country girl—a world in which
Phœbe had appeared to her as a princess reigning in glory and
delight. Ursula forgot both her companions and her recent
occupation. Would the young lady in black notice her; stop,
perhaps, and talk to her—remember her? Her eyes began to
glow and dance with excitement. She stumbled as she went
on in her anxiety, fixing her eyes upon the approaching figure.
Phœbe, for her part, was taking a constitutional walk up and
down Grange Lane, and she too was a little moved, recognizing
the girl, and wondering what it would be wisest to do—whether
to speak to her, and break her lonely promenade with a little
society, or remember her “place,” and save herself from further
mortification by passing the clergyman's daughter, who was a
cousin of the Dorsets, with a bow.</p>

<p>“The Dorsets wouldn't recognise me, nor Miss May either,”
Phœbe said to herself, “<i>if they knew</i>—”</p>

<p>But Ursula looked so wistful as they approached each other
that she had not the courage to keep to this wise resolution.
Though she was only the granddaughter of Tozer, the butterman,
she was much more a woman of the world than this pretty
blushing girl who courted her notice. She put out her hand
instinctively when they met. “It can't harm anybody but
myself, after all,” she thought.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so glad you remember me,” cried Ursula. “I
knew you in a moment. Have you come to stay here? This
is my brother, Reginald, and my little sister, Janey,” (how
Janey scowled at that <i>little!</i> and with reason, for she was by
half an inch the taller of the two). “Are you taking a walk?
I do hope you like Carlingford. I do hope you are going to
stay. That is our house down at the end of the lane, close to
St. Roque's. Papa is the clergyman there. It will be so
delightful,” said Ursula, repeating herself in her excitement,
“if you are going to stay.”</p>

<p>“I am going to stay for some time,” said Phœbe graciously,
“I don't quite know how long. I came here shortly after I
saw you in town. My grandfather lives here. Grange Lane
is very nice for a walk. Grandmamma is an invalid, so that I
don't leave her very often. It was great luck finding you just
as I had come out; for it is not cheerful walking alone.”</p>

<p>Phœbe felt perfectly sure that through each of the three
heads turned towards her a hurried inquiry was going on as to
which of those enclosed houses contained the grandmother who
was an invalid; but no sort of enlightenment followed the
inquiry, and as for Ursula it terminated abruptly in her mind
with a rush of cordiality. She was not at an age when friendship
pauses to make any inquiry into grandmothers.</p>

<p>“I am so glad! for if you are not going anywhere in particular,
we may all walk together. Janey knows you quite
well. I have talked of you so often,” (here Phœbe gave a
gracious bow and smile to Janey, who was not quite sure that
she liked to be thus patronized), “and so does my brother,”
said Ursula, more doubtfully. “Do you like Carlingford?
Have you seen many people? Oh! I do hope you will stay.”</p>

<p>“I have not seen anybody,” said Phœbe. “My people are
not much in society. When one is old and sick, I don't suppose
one cares—”</p>

<p>“There is no society to speak of in Carlingford,” said Reginald.
“It is like most other country towns. If you like it we
shall be sure your liking is quite disinterested, for it has no
social charms—”</p>

<p>When had Reginald said so many words at a time to a young
lady before? The girls exchanged glances. “I think it is
pretty,” said Phœbe, closing the subject. “It is going to snow,
don't you think? I suppose you skate like all the young ladies
now. It seems the first thing any one thinks of when the
winter begins.”</p>

<p>“Do you skate?” said Ursula, her eyes brighter and opener
than ever.</p>

<p>“Oh, a little—as everybody does! Perhaps if there is no
society,” said Phœbe, turning to Reginald for the first time,
“people are free here from the necessity of doing as everybody
does. I don't think there is any such bondage in the world—dressing,
living, working, amusing yourself—you have to do
everything as other people do it. So I skate—I can't help
myself; and a hundred foolish things beside.”</p>

<p>“But I should think it <i>delightful</i>,” cried Ursula, “I have
always envied the boys. They look so warm when we are
all shivering. Reginald, if it freezes will you teach us? I
think I should like it better than anything in the world.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Reginald, “if Miss—if we can make up a party—if
you,” he added with a perfectly new inflection in his voice,
“will come too.”</p>

<p>“I see you don't know my name,” said Phœbe, with a soft
little laugh. “It is Beecham. One never catches names at a
party. I remembered yours because of a family in a novel that
I used to admire very much in my girlish days—”</p>

<p>“Oh! I know,” cried Janey, “the Daisy Chain. We are
not a set of prigs like those people. We are not goody, whatever
we are; we—”</p>

<p>“I don't suppose Miss Beecham cares for your opinion of
the family character,” said Reginald in a tone that made Janey
furious. Thus discoursing they reached the gates of the Parsonage,
where Ursula was most eager that her friend should
come in. And here Mr. May joined them, who was impressed,
like everybody else, by Phœbe's appearance, and made himself
so agreeable that Reginald felt eclipsed and driven into the
background. Ursula had never been so satisfied with her
father in her life; though there was a cloud on Mr. May's soul,
it suited him to show a high good-humour with everybody in
recompense for his son's satisfactory decision, and he was, indeed,
in a state of high complacence with himself for having
managed matters so cleverly that the very thing which should
have secured Reginald's final abandonment of the chaplaincy
determined him, on the contrary, to accept it. And he admired
Phœbe, and was dazzled by her self-possession and knowledge
of the world. He supported Ursula's invitation warmly; but
the stranger freed herself with graceful excuses. She had her
patient to attend to.</p>

<p>“That is a very lady-like young woman,” said Mr. May,
when they had gone in, after watching regretfully their new
acquaintance's progress through Grange Lane. “You met her
in town, did you? A friend of the Dorsets? Where is she
living, I wonder; and whom does she belong to? One does
not often see that style of thing here.”</p>

<p>“I never saw any one like her before,” said Ursula fervently;
and they were still all uniting in admiration of Phœbe—when—</p>

<p>But such an interruption demands another page.</p>

<h3>THAT TOZER GIRL!</h3>


<p>“Well, who is she?” cried Mrs. Sam Hurst, too curious to
think of the ordinary decorums. She had no bonnet on, but a
light “cloud” of white wool over her cap, and her whole aspect
was full of eagerness and excitement. “Why didn't you tell
me you knew her? Who is she? I am dying to know.”</p>

<p>“Who is—who?” said Ursula, rather glad of the opportunity
of being politely rude to Mrs. Sam Hurst before papa.
“How is any one to find out from the way you speak? She?
who is she?”</p>

<p>“That is just what I want you to tell me,” said Mrs. Sam
Hurst, with imperturbable good-humour. “You, Mr. May,
you are always good to me, though Ursula has her little
tempers—the girl you were talking to at the door. I stood
and watched from the window, and I scarcely could contain
myself sufficiently not to bounce out in the middle of the talk.
Now do tell, as the Americans say. Who is that Tozer girl?”</p>

<p>“That Tozer girl!” Ursula gave a little shriek, and grew
first red and then pale with horror and dismay.</p>

<p>“Yes; I told you about her; so well dressed and looking so
nice. That was she; with the very same dress, such a charming
dress! so much style about it. Who is she, Ursula? Mr.
May, tell me who is she? You can't imagine how much I want
to know.”</p>

<p>Ursula dropped into a chair, looking like a little ghost, faint
and rigid. She said afterwards to Janey that she felt in the
depths of her heart that it must be true. She could have cried
with pain and disappointment, but she would not give Mrs.
Sam Hurst the pleasure of making her cry.</p>

<p>“There must be some mistake,” said Reginald, interposing.
“This is a lady—my sister met her in town with the Dorsets.”</p>

<p>“Oh, does she know the Dorsets too?” said the inquirer.
“That makes it still more interesting. Yes, that is the girl
that is with the Tozers; there can be no mistake about it. She
is the granddaughter. She was at the Meeting last night. I
had it from the best authority—on the platform with old Tozer.
And, indeed, Mr. May, how any one that had been there could
dare to look you in the face!—”</p>

<p>“I was there myself,” said Mr. May. “It amused me very
much. Tell me now about this young person. Is she an impostor,
taking people in, or what is it all about? Ursula looks
as if she was in the trick herself, and had been found out.”</p>

<p>“I am <i>sure</i> she is not an impostor,” said Ursula. “An impostor!
If you had seen her as I saw her, at a great, beautiful,
splendid ball. I never saw anything like it. I was nobody
there—nobody—and neither were Cousin Anne and Cousin
Sophy—but Miss Beecham! It is a mistake, I suppose,” the
girl said, raising herself up with great dignity; “when people
are always trying for news, they get the wrong news sometimes,
I don't doubt. You may be sure it is a mistake.”</p>

<p>“That's me,” said Mrs. Sam Hurst, with a laugh; “that is
one of Ursula's assaults upon poor me. Yes, I confess it, I am
fond of news; and I never said she was an impostor. Poor
girl, I am dreadfully sorry for her. I think she is a good girl,
trying to do her duty to her relations. She didn't choose her
own grandfather. I dare say, if she'd had any say in it, she
would have made a very different choice. But whether your
papa may think her a proper friend for you—being Tozer's
granddaughter, Miss Ursula, that's quite a different business,
I am bound to say.”</p>

<p>Again Ursula felt herself kept from crying by sheer pride,
and nothing else. She bit her lips tight; she would not give
in. Mrs. Hurst to triumph over her, and to give her opinion
as to what papa might think proper! Ursula turned her back
upon Mrs. Hurst, which was not civil, fearing every moment
some denunciation from papa. But nothing of the kind came.
He asked quite quietly after a while, “Where did you meet
this young lady?” without any perceptible inflection of anger
in his tone.</p>

<p>“Why, papa,” cried Janey, distressed to be kept so long
silent, “everybody knows where Ursula met her; no one has
heard of anything else since she came home. She met her of
course at the ball. You know; Reginald, <i>you</i> know! The
ball where she went with Cousin Anne.”</p>

<p>“Never mind Cousin Anne; I want the name of the people
at whose house it was.”</p>

<p>“Copperhead, papa,” said Ursula, rousing herself. “If
Cousin Anne does not know a lady from a common person, who
does, I wonder? It was Cousin Anne who introduced me to
her (I think). Their name was Copperhead, and they lived in
a great, big, beautiful house, in the street where ambassadors
and quantities of great people live. I forget the name of it;
but I know there was an ambassador lived there, and Cousin
Anne said——”</p>

<p>“Copperhead! I thought so,” said Mr. May. “When
Ursula has been set a-going on the subject of Cousin Anne,
there is nothing rational to be got from her after that for an
hour or two. You take an interest in this young lady,” he said
shortly, turning to Mrs. Sam Hurst, who stood by smiling,
rather enjoying the commotion she had caused.</p>

<p>“Who, I? I take an interest in anybody that makes a stir,
and gives us something to talk about,” said Mrs. Hurst, frankly.
“You know my weakness. Ursula despises me for it, but you
know human nature. If I did not take an interest in my
neighbours what would become of me—a poor lone elderly
woman, without either chick or child?”</p>

<p>She rounded off this forlorn description of herself with a
hearty laugh, in which Janey, who had a secret kindness for
their merry neighbour, though she feared her “for papa,” joined
furtively. Mr. May, however, did not enter into the joke with
the sympathy which he usually showed to Mrs. Hurst. He
smiled, but there was something <i>distrait</i> and pre-occupied in his
air.</p>

<p>“How sorry we all are for you,” he said; “your position is
truly melancholy. I am glad, for your sake, that old Tozer
has a pretty granddaughter to beguile you now and then out
of recollection of your cares.”</p>

<p>There was a sharp tone in this which caught Mrs. Hurst's
ear, and she was not disposed to accept any sharpness from Mr.
May. She turned the tables upon him promptly.</p>

<p>“What a disgraceful business that Meeting was! Of course,
you have seen the paper. There ought to be some way of
punishing those agitators that go about the country, taking
away people's characters. Could not you bring him up for
libel, or Reginald? I never knew anything so shocking. To
come to your own town, your own neighbourhood, and to strike
you through your son! It is the nastiest, most underhanded,
unprincipled attack I ever heard of.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Reginald.</p>

<p>He was not easily roused by Carlingford gossip, but there
was clearly more in this than met the eye.</p>

<p>“An Anti-State Church Meeting,” said Mr. May, “with
special compliments in it to you and me. It is not worth our
while to think of it. Your agitators, my dear Mrs. Hurst, are
not worth powder and shot. Now, pardon me, but I must go
to work. Will you go and see the sick people in Back Grove
Street, Reginald? I don't think I can go to-day.”</p>

<p>“I should like to know what was in the paper,” said the
young man, with an obstinacy that filled the girls with alarm.
They had been in hopes that everything between father and son
was to be happy and friendly, now that Reginald was about to
do what his father wished.</p>

<p>“Oh, you shall see it,” said Mrs. Hurst, half alarmed too;
“but it is not anything, as your father says; only we women
are sensitive. We are always thinking of things which, perhaps,
were never intended to harm us. Ursula, you take my advice,
and don't go and mix yourself up with Dissenters and that kind
of people. The Tozer girl may be very nice, but she is still
Tozer's granddaughter, after all.”</p>

<p>Reginald followed the visitor out of the room, leaving his sisters
very ill at ease within, and his father not without anxieties
which were so powerful, indeed, that he relieved his mind by
talking of them to his daughters—a most unusual proceeding.</p>

<p>“That woman will set Reginald off at the nail again,” he
cried; “after he had begun to see things in a common-sense
light. There was an attack made upon him last night on account
of that blessed chaplaincy, which has been more trouble
to me than it is worth. I suppose he'll throw it up now. But
I wash my hands of the matter. I wonder how you girls can
encourage that chattering woman to come here.”</p>

<p>“Papa!” cried Janey, ever on the defensive, “we <i>hate</i> her!
It is you who encourage her to come here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, hush!” cried Ursula, with a warning glance; it was
balm to her soul to hear her father call Mrs. Hurst <i>that woman</i>.
“We have been to see the house,” she said; “it was very nice.
I think Reginald liked it, papa.”</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” said Mr. May, “girls and boys are queer articles.
I dare say the house, if he likes it, will weigh more with him
than justice or common sense. So Copperhead was the people's
name? What would be wanted, do you think, Ursula, to
make Reginald's room into a comfortable room for a pupil?
Comfortable, recollect; not merely what would do; and one
that has been used, I suppose, to luxury. You can look over
it and let me know.”</p>

<p>“Are we going to take a pupil, papa?” cried Janey, with
widening eyes.</p>

<p>“I don't know what you could teach him,” he said. “Manners,
perhaps? Let me know, Ursula. The room is not a bad
room; it would want a new carpet, curtains, perhaps—various
things. Make me out a list. The Copperheads have a son, I
believe. Did you see him at that fine ball of yours?”</p>

<p>“Oh! papa, he danced with me twice; he was very kind,”
said Ursula, with a blush; “and he danced all the night with
Miss Beecham. It must be a falsehood about her being old
Tozer's granddaughter. Mr. Clarence Copperhead was always
by her side. I think Mrs. Hurst must have made it all up out
of her own head.”</p>

<p>Mr. May gave a little short laugh.</p>

<p>“Poor Mrs. Hurst!” he said, recovering his temper; “how
bitter you all are against her. So he danced with you twice?
You must try to make him comfortable, Ursula, if he comes
here.”</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Clarence Copperhead coming here?”</p>

<p>Ursula was struck dumb by this piece of news. The grand
house in Portland Place, and all Sophy Dorset's questions and
warnings, came suddenly back to her mind. She blushed fiery
red; she could not tell why. Coming here! How strange it
would be, how extraordinary, to have to order dinner for him,
and get his room in order, and have him in the drawing-room
in the evenings! How should she know what to say to him?
or would papa keep him always at work, reading Greek or
something downstairs? All this flashed through her mind
with the rapidity of lightning. Mr. May made no reply. He
was walking up and down the room with his hands behind him,
as was his habit when he was “busy.” Being busy was separated
from being angry by the merest visionary line in Mr.
May's case; his children never ventured on addressing him at
such moments, and it is impossible to describe how glad they
were when he withdrew to his own room before Reginald's return;
but not a minute too soon. The young man came back,
looking black as night. He threw himself into a chair, and
then he got up again, and began also to walk about the room
like his father. At first he would make no reply to the questions
of the girls.</p>

<p>“It is exactly what I expected,” he said; “just what I
looked for. I knew it from the first moment.”</p>

<p>It was Janey, naturally, who had least patience with this unsatisfactory
utterance.</p>

<p>“If it was just what you expected, and you looked for it all
the time, why should you make such a fuss now?” she cried.
“I declare, for all you are young, and we are fond of you, you
are almost as bad as papa.”</p>

<p>Reginald did not take any notice of this address; he went
on repeating the same words at intervals.</p>

<p>“A child might have known it. Of course, from the beginning
one knew how it must be.” Then he suddenly faced
round upon Ursula, who was nearly crying in excitement and
surprise. “But if they think I am to be driven out of a resolution
I have made by what they say—if they think that I
will be bullied into giving up because of their claptrap,” he
cried, looking sternly at her, “then you will find you are mistaken.
You will find I am not such a weak idiot as you
suppose. Give up! because some demagogue from a Dissenting
Committee takes upon him to criticise my conduct.
If you think I have so little self-respect, so little stamina,” he
said, fiercely, “you will find you have made a very great
mistake.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Reginald, <i>me</i>?” cried Ursula, with tears in her eyes;
“did I ever think anything unkind of you? did I ever ask you
to do anything that was disagreeable? You should not look
as if it was me.”</p>

<p>Then he threw himself down again on the old sofa, which
creaked and tottered under the shock.</p>

<p>“Poor little Ursula!” he cried, with a short laugh. “Did
you think I meant you? But if they thought they would
master me by these means,” said Reginald with pale fury,
“they never made a greater mistake, I can tell you. A parcel
of trumpery agitators, speechifiers, little petty demagogues,
whom nobody ever heard of before. A fine thing, indeed, to
have all the shopkeepers of Carlingford sitting in committee on
one's conduct, isn't it—telling one what one ought to do? By
Jupiter! It's enough to make a man swear!”</p>

<p>“I declare!” cried Janey loudly, “how like Reginald is to
papa! I never saw it before. When he looks wicked like that,
and sets his teeth—but I am not going to be pushed, not by
my brother or any one!” said the girl, growing red, and making
a step out of his reach. “I won't stand it. I am not a child
any more than you.”</p>

<p>Janey's wrath was appeased, however, when Reginald produced
the paper and read Northcote's speech aloud. In her
interest she drew nearer and nearer, and read the obnoxious
column over his shoulder, joining in Ursula's cries of indignation.
By the time the three had thus got through it, Reginald's
own agitation subsided into that fierce amusement which is the
frequent refuge of the assaulted.</p>

<p>“Old Green in the chair! and old Tozer and the rest have all
been sitting upon me,” he said, with that laugh which is proverbially
described as from the wrong side of the mouth, whatever
that may be. Ursula said nothing in reply, but in her heart
she felt yet another stab. Tozer! This was another complication.
She had taken so great a romantic interest in the
heroine of that ball, which was the most entrancing moment of
Ursula's life, that it seemed a kind of disloyalty to her dreams
to give up thus completely, and dethrone the young lady in
black; but what could the poor girl do? In the excitement
of this question the personality of Reginald's special assailant
was lost altogether: the girls did not even remember his name.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXI"/>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>A NEW FRIEND.</h3>


<p>After this there followed an exciting interval for the family
at the Parsonage. Reginald, with the impatience of anger, insisted
upon transporting himself to the College at once, and
entering upon “his duties,” such as they were, in defiance of
all public comment. And Mr. May, delighted with the head-strong
resentment which served his purpose so well, promoted
it by all the means in his power, goading his son on, if he
showed any signs of relaxing, by references to public opinion,
and what the Liberation Society would say. Before those
curtains were ready, which the girls had ordered with so much
pride, or the carpet laid down, he had taken possession, and
his room in the Parsonage was already turned upside down
preparing for a new inmate. Many and strange were the
thoughts in Ursula's mind about this new inmate. She remembered
Clarence Copperhead as a full-grown man, beyond, it
seemed to her, the age at which pupilage was possible. What
was he coming to Carlingford for? What was he coming to
the Parsonage for? What could papa do with a pupil quite as
old as Reginald, who, in his own person, had often taken pupils?
Ursula had read as many novels as were natural at her age, and
can it be supposed that she did not ask herself whether there
was any other meaning in it? Could he be coming to Carlingford
on account of Miss Beecham; or, on account of—any
one else? Ursula never whispered, even to her own imagination,
on account of me. But it is not to be supposed that the
unbidden inarticulate thought did not steal in, fluttering her
girlish soul. Everybody knows that in fiction, at least, such
things occur continually, and are the most natural things in
the world; and to Ursula, beyond her own little commonplace
world, which she somewhat despised, and the strange world
undeciphered and wonderful to which the Dorsets had introduced
her for those ten brief days in London, the world of
fiction was the only sphere she knew; and in that sphere there
could be no such natural method of accounting for a young
man's actions as that of supposing him to be “in love.” The
question remained, was it with Miss Beecham, or was it with—anybody
else? Such an inquiry could not but flutter her
youthful bosom. She made his room ready for him, and settled
how he was to be disposed of, with the strangest sense of
something beneath, which her father would never suspect, but
which, perhaps, she alone might know.</p>

<p>Clarence Copperhead was a more imposing figure to Ursula
than he was in reality. She had seen him only twice, and he
was a big and full-grown “gentleman,” while Ursula only
realised herself as a little girl. She was not even aware that
she had any intelligence to speak of, or that she would be a fit
person to judge of “a gentleman.” To be sure she had to do
many things which wanted thought and sense; but she was too
unthoughtful of herself to have decided this as yet, or to have
created any private tribunal at which to judge a new-comer of
Clarence Copperhead's dimensions. A much greater personage
than she was, an individual whose comings and goings could
not be without observation, whose notice would be something
exciting and strange, was what she took him to be. And
Ursula was excited. Did Mrs. Copperhead, that kind little
woman, know why he was coming—was she in his confidence?
And how was Ursula to entertain him, to talk to him—a gentleman
accustomed to so much better society? She did not
say anything to Janey on this subject, though Janey was not
without her curiosities too, and openly indulged in conjectures
as to the new pupil.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he will be fine. I wonder if he will be very
good,” said Janey. “I wonder if he will fall in love with
Ursula. Pupils, in books, always do; and then there is a
dreadful fuss and bother, and the girl is sent away. It is hard
for the girl; it is always supposed to be her fault. I would
not allow papa to take any pupils if it was me.”</p>

<p>“And much your papa would care for your permission,” said
Mrs. Sam Hurst. “But so far I agree with you, Janey, that
before he has pupils, or anything of that sort, there ought to
be a lady in the house. He should marry—”</p>

<p>“Marry! we don't want a lady in the house,” cried Janey,
“we are ladies ourselves, I hope. Marry! if he does, I, for
one, will do all I can to make his life miserable,” said the girl
with energy. “What should he want to marry for when he
has daughters grown up? There are enough of us already, I
should think.”</p>

<p>“Too many,” said Mrs. Sam Hurst with a sigh. It gave her
the greatest secret delight to play upon the girl's fears.</p>

<p>Besides this, however, Ursula had another pre-occupation.
In that cordial meeting with the young lady who had turned
out to be a person in such an embarrassing position, there had
been a great deal said about future meetings, walks, and expeditions
together, and Ursula had been very desirous that Phœbe
should fix some time for their first encounter. She thought of
this now with blushes that seemed to burn her cheeks. She
was afraid to go out, lest she should meet the girl she had been
so anxious to make a friend of. Not that, on her own account,
after the first shock, Ursula would have been hard-hearted
enough to deny her acquaintance to Tozer's granddaughter.
In the seclusion of her chamber, she had cried over the downfall
of her ideal friend very bitterly, and felt the humiliation
for Phœbe more cruelly than that young lady felt it for herself;
but Ursula, however much it might have cost her, would have
stood fast to her friendship had she been free to do as she
pleased.</p>

<p>“I did not like her for her grandfather,” she said to Janey,
of whom, in this case, she was less unwilling to make a confidant.
“I never thought of the grandfather. What does it
matter to me if he were a sweep instead of old Tozer?”</p>

<p>“Old Tozer is just as bad as if he were a sweep,” said Janey;
“if you had ever thought of her grandfather, and known he
was old Tozer, you would have felt it would not do.”</p>

<p>“What is there about a grandfather? I don't know if we
ever had any,” said Ursula. “Mamma had, for the Dorsets are
her relations—but papa. Mr. Griffiths's grandfather was a
candle-maker; I have heard papa say so—and they go everywhere.”</p>

<p>“But he is dead,” said Janey, with great shrewdness, “and
he was rich.”</p>

<p>“You little nasty calculating thing! Oh, how I hate rich
people; how I hate this horrid world, that loves money and
loves fine names, and does not care for people's selves whether
they are bad or good! I shall never dare to walk up Grange
Lane again,” said Ursula, with tears. “Fancy changing to her,
after being so glad to see her! fancy never saying another
word about the skating, or the walk to the old mill! How she
will despise me for being such a miserable creature! and she
will think it is all my own fault.”</p>

<p>At this moment Mr. May, from the door of his study, called
“Ursula!” repeating the call with some impatience when she
paused to dry her eyes. She ran down to him quickly, throwing
down her work in her haste. He was standing at the door,
and somehow for the first time the worn look about his eyes
struck Ursula with a touch of pity. She had never noticed
it before: a look of suppressed pain and anxiety, which remained
about his eyes though the mouth smiled. It had never
occurred to her to be sorry for her father before, and the idea
struck her as very strange now.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he said, “I want to speak to you. I have been
thinking about the young woman—this friend of yours. We
are all among the Dissenters now-a-days, whatever Mrs. Sam
Hurst may say. You seem to have taken a fancy to this Tozer
girl?”</p>

<p>“Don't call her so, papa, please. She is a lady in herself, as
good a lady as any one.”</p>

<p>“Well! I don't say anything against her, do I? So you
hold by your fancy? You are not afraid of Grange Lane and
Mrs. Sam Hurst.”</p>

<p>“I have not seen her again,” said Ursula, cast down. “I
have not been out at all. I could not bear to be so friendly
one day, and then to pass as if one did not know her the next.
I cannot do it,” cried the girl, in tears; “if I see her, I must
just be the same as usual to her, whatever you say.”</p>

<p>“Very well, <i>be</i> the same as usual,” said Mr. May; “that is
why I called you. I have my reasons. Notwithstanding
Tozer, be civil to the girl. I have my reasons for what I say.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean it, papa!” said Ursula, delighted. “Oh,
how good of you! You don't mind—you really don't mind?
Oh! I can't tell you how thankful I am; for to pretend to want
to be friends, and then to break off all in a moment because of
a girl's grandfather——”</p>

<p>“Don't make a principle of it, Ursula. It is quite necessary,
in an ordinary way, to think of a girl's grandfather—and a boy's
too, for that matter. No shopkeeping friends for me; but in
this individual case I am willing to make an exception. For
the moment, you see, Dissenters are in the ascendant. Young
Copperhead is coming next week. Now, go.”</p>

<p>Ursula marched delighted upstairs. “Janey, run and get
your hat,” she said; “I am going out. I am not afraid of any
one now. Papa is a great deal nicer than he ever was before.
He says I may see Miss Beecham as much as I like. He says
we need not mind Mrs. Sam Hurst. I am so glad! I shall
never be afraid of that woman any more.”</p>

<p>Janey was taken altogether by surprise. “I hope he is not
going to fall in love with Miss Beecham,” she said suspiciously.
“I have heard Betsy say that old gentlemen often do.”</p>

<p>“He is not so foolish as to fall in love with anybody,” said
Ursula, with dignity. “Indeed, Janey, you ought to have
much more respect for papa. I wish you could be sent to school
and learn more sense. You give your opinion as if you were—twenty—more
than that. I am sure I never should have
ventured to say such things when I was a child like you.”</p>

<p>“Child yourself!” said Janey indignant; which was her last
resource when she had nothing more to say; but Ursula was
too busy putting aside her work and preparing for her walk to
pay any attention. In proportion as she had been subdued
and downcast heretofore, she was gay now. She forgot all
about old Tozer; about the Dissenters' meeting, and the man
who had made an attack upon poor Reginald. She flew to her
room for her hat and jacket, and ran downstairs, singing to
herself. Janey only overtook her, out of breath, as she emerged
into the road from the Parsonage door.</p>

<p>“What a dreadful hurry you are in,” said Janey. “I always
get ready so much quicker than you do. Is it all about this
girl, because she is new? I never knew you were so fond of
new people before.”</p>

<p>But that day they went up and down Grange Lane fruitlessly,
without seeing anything of Phœbe, and Ursula returned home
disconsolate. In the evening Reginald intimated carelessly
that he had met Miss Beecham. “She is much better worth
talking to than most of the girls one meets with, whoever her
grandfather may be,” he said, evidently with an instant readiness
to stand on the defensive.</p>

<p>“Oh, did you talk to her,” said Ursula, “without knowing?
Reginald, papa has no objections. He says we may even
have her here, if we please.”</p>

<p>“Well, of course I suppose he must guide you in that
respect,” said Reginald, “but it does not matter particularly
to me. Of course I talked to her. Even my father could not
expect that his permission was needed for me.”</p>

<p>At which piece of self-assertion the girls looked at him with
admiring eyes. Already they felt there was a difference.
Reginald at home, nominal curate, without pay or position,
was a different thing from Reginald with an appointment,
a house of his own, and two hundred and fifty pounds a
year. The girls looked at him admiringly, but felt that this
was never likely to be their fate. In everything the boys had so
much the best of it; and yet it was almost a comfort to think
that they had seen Reginald himself trembling before papa.
Reginald had a great deal to tell them about the college,
about the old men who made a hundred daily claims on his
attention, and the charities which he had to administer, doles
of this and that, and several charity schools of a humble class.</p>

<p>“As for my time, it is not likely to hang on my hands as I
thought. I can't be a parish Quixote, as we planned, Ursula,
knocking down windmills for other people,” he said, adjusting
his round edge of collar. He was changed; he was important,
a personage in his own sight, no longer to be spoken of as Mr.
May's son. Janey ventured on a little laugh when he went
away, but Ursula did not like the change.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” cried Janey; “I hope Copperhead will be
nice. We shall have him to talk to, when he comes.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Ursula, in a kind of despair, “who taught you
to call gentlemen like that by their name? There is nothing
so vulgar. Why, Cousin Anne says—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cousin Anne!” cried Janey, shaking her head, and
dancing away. After that she was aware there was nothing
for it but flight.</p>

<p>Next day, however, they were more successful. Phœbe,
though very little older than Ursula, was kind to the country
girls, and talked to them both, and drew them out. She smiled
when she heard of Clarence Copperhead, and told them that
he was not very clever, but she did not think there was any
harm in him.</p>

<p>“It is his father who is disagreeable,” said Phœbe; “didn't
you think so? You know, papa is a minister, Miss May,”
(she did not say clergyman when she spoke to a churchwoman,
for what was the use of exciting any one's prejudices?) “and
Mr. Copperhead comes to our church. You may be very
thankful, in that respect, that you are not a dissenter. But it
will be very strange to see Clarence Copperhead in Carlingford.
I have known him since I was no bigger than your little
sister. To tell the truth,” said Phœbe, frankly, “I think I am
rather sorry he is coming here.”</p>

<p>“Why?” cried bold Janey, who was always inquisitive.</p>

<p>Miss Phœbe only smiled and shook her head; she made no
distinct reply.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow, I suppose he has been 'plucked,' as the
gentlemen call it, or 'ploughed,' does your brother say?
University slang is very droll. He has not taken his degree, I
suppose, and they want him to work before going up again. I
am sorry for your father, too, for I don't think it will be very
easy to get anything into Clarence Copperhead's mind. But
there is no harm at all in him, and he used to be very nice to
his mother. Mamma and I liked him for that; he was always
very nice to his mother.”</p>

<p>“Will you come in and have some tea?” said Ursula. “Do,
please. I hope, now that I have met you again, you will not
refuse me. I was afraid you had gone away, or something—”</p>

<p>Ursula, however, could not help looking guilty as she spoke,
and Phœbe perceived at once that there had been some reason
for the two or three days disappearance of the girls from
Grange Lane.</p>

<p>“You must tell me first,” she said, with a smile, “whether
you know who I am. If you ask me after that, I shall come.
I am old Mr. Tozer's granddaughter, who had a shop in the High
Street. My uncle has a shop there now. I do not like it myself,”
said Phœbe, with the masterly candour that distinguished
her, “and no one else can be expected to like it. If you did
not know—”</p>

<p>“Oh, we heard directly,” cried Janey; “Mrs. Sam Hurst
told us. She came shrieking, 'Who is she?' before your back
was turned that day; for she wondered to see you with old
Tozer—”</p>

<p>“Janey!” cried Ursula, with horror. “Of course we know;
and please will you come? Every new person in Carlingford
gets talked over, and if an angel were to walk about, Mrs. Sam
Hurst would never rest till she had found out where he came
from.”</p>

<p>“And, perhaps, whether he had a broken feather in his
wing,” said Phœbe. “I am very glad you don't mind. It
will be very pleasant to come. I will run in and tell them, and
then I will join you. Grandmamma is an invalid, and would
like to know where I am.”</p>

<p>And the news made a considerable flutter in the dim room
where Mrs. Tozer sat between the fire and the window, looking
out upon the crocuses and regretting the High Street.</p>

<p>“But run and put on another dress, dear. What will they
think of you in that everlasting brown frock as you're so fond
of? I'd like them to see as my grandchild could dress as nice
as any lady in the land.”</p>

<p>“She'll not see much finery there,” said Tozer; “they're
as poor as church mice, are them Mays, and never a penny to
pay a bill when it's wanted. I don't think as Phœbe need
mind her dressing to go there.”</p>

<p>“And you'll send for me if you want me, grandmamma;
you will be sure to send?”</p>

<p>But for the brown frock, Mrs. Tozer's satisfaction would
have been unalloyed as she watched her granddaughter walking
across the garden.</p>

<p>“She's at home among the quality, she is,” said the old
woman; “maybe more so than she is with you and me; but
there ain't a better girl in all England, and that I'll say for her,
though if she would think a little more about her clothes, as is
nat'ral at her age, it would be more pleasing to me.”</p>

<p>“The worst dress as Phœbe has is better than anything
belonging to them Mays,” said Tozer.</p>

<p>He did not care for the parson at St. Roque; though he was
pleased that his child should be among “the quality.” But it
was on that evening that poor old Mrs. Tozer had one of her
attacks, and Phœbe had to be summoned back at an early hour.
The servant went down with an umbrella and a note, to bring
her home; and that trifling incident had its influence upon
after affairs, as the reader shall shortly see.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXII"/>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>A DESPERATE EXPEDIENT.</h3>


<p>It was something of a comfort to Phœbe to find that the
“tea” to which Ursula asked her was a family meal, such as
Mr. and Mrs. Tozer indulged in, in Grange Lane, with no idea
of dinner to follow, as in more refined circles. This, she said
to herself benignly, must be “country fashion,” and she was
naturally as bland and gracious at the Parsonage tea-table as
anybody from town, knowing better, but desiring to make herself
thoroughly agreeable, could be. She amused Mr. May
very much, who felt the serene young princess, accepting her
vulgar relations with gentle resignation, and supported by a
feeling of her own innate dignity, to be something quite new
to him. Phœbe had no objection to talk upon the subject, for,
clever as she was, she was not so clever as to see through Mr.
May's amused show of interest in her trials, but believed ingenuously
that he understood and felt for her, and was, perhaps,
at last, the one noble, impartial, and generous Churchman who
could see the difficulties of cultivated Dissenters, and enter into
them sympathetically. Why Mr. May took the trouble to
draw her out on this point it is more difficult to explain. Poor
man, he was in a state of semi-distraction over Cotsdean's bill.
The ten days had shortened into three, and he was no nearer
finding that hundred pounds than ever. Even while he smiled
and talked to Phœbe, he was repeating over and over to himself
the terrible fact which could not now be ignored. “17th,
18th, 19th, and Friday will be the 20th,” he was saying to himself.
If that 20th came without any help, Cotsdean would be
virtually made a bankrupt; for of course all his creditors
would make a rush upon him, and all his affairs would be
thrown open to the remorseless public gaze, if the bill, which
had been so often renewed, had to be dishonoured at last. Mr.
May had a conscience, though he was not careful of his money,
and the fear of ruin to Cotsdean was a very terrible and real
oppression to him. The recollection was upon him like a vulture
in classic story, tearing and gnawing, as he sat there and
smiled over the cup of tea Ursula gave him, feeling amused all
the same at Phœbe's talk. He could scarcely have told why he
had permitted his daughter to pursue her acquaintance with
Tozer's granddaughter. Partly it was because of Clarence
Copperhead; out of curiosity, as, being about to be brought in
contact with some South Sea Islander or Fijian, one would
naturally wish to see another who was thrown in one's way by
accident, and thus prepare one's self for the permanent acquaintance.
And she amused him. Her cleverness, her ease, her
conversational powers, her woman of the world aspect, did not
so much impress him, perhaps, as they did others; but the
complacency and innocent confidence of youth that were in her,
and her own enjoyment of the situation, notwithstanding the
mortifications incurred—all this amused Mr. May. He listened
to her talk, sometimes feeling himself almost unable to
bear it, for the misery of those words, which kept themselves
ringing in a dismal chorus in his own mind, and yet deriving a
kind of amusement and distraction from it all the same.</p>

<p>“One of your friends was very hard upon my son—and myself—at
your Meeting the other night, Miss Beecham.”</p>

<p>“He was very injudicious,” said Phœbe, shaking her head.
“Indeed I did not approve. Personalities never advance any
cause. I said so to him. Don't you think the Church has
herself to blame for those political Dissenters, Mr. May? You
sneer at us, and look down upon us—”</p>

<p>“I? I don't sneer at anybody.”</p>

<p>“I don't mean you individually; but Churchmen do. They
treat us as if we were some strange kind of creatures, from the
heart of Africa perhaps. They don't think we are just like
themselves: as well educated; meaning as well; with as much
right to our own ideas.”</p>

<p>Mr. May could scarcely restrain a laugh. “Just like themselves.”
The idea of a Dissenter setting up to be as well
educated, and as capable of forming an opinion, as a cultivated
Anglican, an Oxford man, and a beneficed clergyman, was too
novel and too foolish not to be somewhat startling as well.
Mr. May was aware that human nature is strangely blind to its
own deficiencies, but was it possible that any delusion could go
so far as this? He did laugh a little—just the ghost of a
laugh—at the idea. But what is the use of making any serious
opposition to such a statement? The very fact of contesting
the assumption seemed to give it a certain weight.</p>

<p>“Whenever this is done,” said Phœbe, with serene philosophy,
“I think you may expect a revulsion of feeling. The
class to which papa belongs is very friendly to the Established
Church, and wishes to do her every honour.”</p>

<p>“Is it indeed? We ought to be much gratified,” said Mr.
May.</p>

<p>Phœbe gave him a quick glance, but he composed his face
and met her look meekly. It actually diverted him from his
pre-occupation, and that is a great deal to say.</p>

<p>“We would willingly do her any honour; we would willingly
be friends, even look up to her, if that would please her,” added
Phœbe, very gravely, conscious of the importance of what she
was saying; “but when we see clergymen, and common persons
also, who have never had one rational thought on the subject,
always setting us down as ignorant and uncultured,
because we are Dissenters——”</p>

<p>“But no one does that,” said Ursula, soothingly, eager to
save her new friend's feelings. She paused in the act of pouring
out the children's second cup of tea, and looked up at her
with eyes full of caressing and flattering meaning. “No one,
at least, I am sure,” she added, faltering, remembering suddenly
things she had heard said of Dissenters, “who knows
<i>you</i>.”</p>

<p>“It is not I that ought to be thought of, it is the general
question. Then can you wonder that a young man like the
gentleman we were talking of, clever and energetic, and an excellent
scholar (and very good in philosophy, too—he was at
Jena for two or three years), should be made bitter when he
feels himself thrust back upon a community of small shopkeepers?”</p>

<p>Mr. May could not restrain another short laugh.</p>

<p>“We must not join in the vulgar abuse of shopkeepers,” he
said.</p>

<p>Phœbe's colour rose. She raised her head a little, then perceiving
the superiority of her former position, smiled.</p>

<p>“I have no right to do so. My people, I suppose, were all
shopkeepers to begin with; but this gives me ways of knowing.
Grandpapa is very kind and nice—really nice, Mr. May; but
he has not at all a wide way of looking at things. I feel it,
though they are so kind to me. I have been brought up to
think in such a different way; and if I feel it, who am fond of
them, think how that young minister must feel it, who was
brought up in a totally different class?”</p>

<p>“What kind of class was this one brought up in?” said Mr.
May, with a laugh. “He need not have assaulted Reginald, if
he had been born a prince. We had done him no harm.”</p>

<p>“That is making it entirely a private question,” said Phœbe,
suavely, “which I did not mean to do. When such a man
finds out abuses—what he takes to be abuses—in the Church,
which treats him like a roadside ranter, may not he feel a right
to be indignant? Oh, I am not so. I think such an office as
that chaplaincy is very good, one here and there for the reward
of merit; and I think he was very right to take it; but still it
would not do, would it, to have many of them? It would not
answer any good purpose,” she said, administering a little sting
scientifically, “if all clergymen held sinecures.”</p>

<p>These words were overheard by Reginald, who just then came
in, and to whom it was startling to find Phœbe serenely seated
at tea with his family. The hated word sinecure did not seem
to affect him from her lips as it would have done from any one
else's. He came in quite good-humouredly, and said with a
smile—</p>

<p>“You are discussing me. What about me? Miss Beecham,
I hope you take my side.”</p>

<p>“I take everybody's side,” said Phœbe; “for I try to trace
people's motives. I can sympathise both with you and those
who assailed you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that Dissenting fellow. I beg your pardon, Miss
Beecham, if you are a Dissenter; but I cannot help it. We
never go out of our way to attack them and their chapels and
coteries, and why should they spring at our throats on every
occasion? I think it is hard, and I can't say I have any charity
to spare for this individual. What had we done to him?
Ursula, give me some tea.”</p>

<p>“Miss Beecham, I leave the cause of the Church in younger
and, I hope, abler hands,” said Mr. May, getting up.</p>

<p>Partly it was that Reginald's onslaught made him see for the
first time certain weak points in the situation; partly it was
that his private care became too clamorous, and he could not
keep on further. He went away quite abruptly, and went
downstairs to his study, and shut himself in there; and the
moment he had closed the door, all this amusement floated
away, and the vulture gripped at him, beak and talons digging
into his very soul. Good God! what was he to do? He
covered his face with his hands, and turned round and round
mentally in that darkness to see if anywhere there might be a
gleam of light; but none was visible east or west. A hundred
pounds, only a hundred pounds; a bagatelle, a thing that to
many men was as small an affair as a stray sixpence; and here
was this man, as good, so to speak, as any—well educated, full
of gifts and accomplishments, well born, well connected, not a
prodigal nor open sinner, losing himself in the very blackness
of darkness, feeling that a kind of moral extinction was the
only prospect before him, for want of this little sum. It
seemed incredible even to himself, as he sat and brooded over
it. Somehow, surely, there must be a way of deliverance. He
looked piteously about him in his solitude, appealing to the
very blank walls to save him. What could they do? His few
books, his faded old furniture, would scarcely realize a hundred
pounds if they were sold to-morrow. All his friends had been
wearied out, all natural resources had failed. James might
any day have sent the money, but he had not done so—just
this special time, when it was so hard to get it, James, too, had
failed; and the hours of this night were stealing away like
thieves, so swift and so noiseless, to be followed by the others;
and Cotsdean, poor soul, his faithful retainer, would be broken
and ruined. To do Mr. May justice, if it had been only himself
who could be ruined, he would have felt it less; but it went
to his very heart to think of poor Cotsdean, who had trusted in
him so entirely, and to whom, indeed, he had been very kind in
his day. Strife and discord had been in the poor man's house,
and perpetual wretchedness, and Mr. May had managed, he
himself could scarcely tell how, to set it right. He had frightened
and subdued the passionate wife, and quenched the growing
tendencies to evil, which made her temper worse than it
was by nature, and had won her back to soberness and some
kind of peace, changing the unhappy house into one of comparative
comfort and cheerfulness. Most people like those best
to whom they have been kind, whom they have served or benefited,
and in this way Mr. May was fond of Cotsdean, who in
his turn had been a very good friend to his clergyman, serving
him as none of his own class could have done, going in the face
of all his own prejudices and the timorousness of nature, on
his account. And the result was to be ruin—ruin unmitigated
to the small man who was in business, and equally disastrous,
though in a less creditable way, to his employer. It was with
a suppressed anguish which is indescribable that he sat there,
with his face covered, looking this approaching misery in the
face. How long he had been there, he could scarcely himself
tell, when he heard a little commotion in the hall, the sounds
of running up and down stairs, and opening of doors. He was
in a feverish and restless condition, and every stir roused him.
Partly because of that impatience in his mind, and partly because
every new thing seemed to have some possibility of hope in it,
he got up and went to the door. Before he returned to his
seat, something might have occurred to him, something might
have happened—who could tell? It might be the postman
with a letter containing that remittance from James, which still
would set all right. It might be—he rose suddenly, and opening
the door, held it ajar and looked out; the front door was
open, and the night air blowing chilly into the house, and on
the stairs, coming down, he heard the voices of Ursula and
Phœbe. Ursula was pinning a shawl round her new friend,
and consoling her.</p>

<p>“I hope you will find it is nothing. I am so sorry,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not very much afraid,” said Phœbe. “She is ill,
but not very bad, I hope; and it is not dangerous. Thank you
so much for letting me come.”</p>

<p>“You will come again?” said Ursula, kissing her; “promise
that you will come again.”</p>

<p>Mr. May listened with a certain surface of amusement in his
mind. How easy and facile these girlish loves and fancies
were! Ursula knew nothing of this stranger, and yet so free
were the girl's thoughts, so open her heart to receive impressions,
that on so short knowledge she had received the other into it
with undoubting confidence and trust. He did not come forward
himself to say good-bye, but he perceived that Reginald
followed downstairs, and took his hat from the table, to accompany
Phœbe home. As they closed the outer door behind
them, the last gust thus forcibly shut in made a rush through
the narrow hall, and carried a scrap of paper to Mr. May's
feet. He picked it up almost mechanically, and carried it with
him to the light, and looked at it without thought. There was
not much in it to interest any one. It was the little note
which Tozer had sent to his granddaughter by the maid, not
prettily folded, to begin with, and soiled and crumpled by the
bearer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Your grandmother is took bad with one of her attacks.
Come back directly. She wants you badly.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">“<span class="smcap">Saml. Tozer.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>This was all that was in it. Mr. May opened it out on his
table with a half-smile of that same superficial amusement
which the entire incident had caused him—the contact, even
momentary, of his own household with that of Tozer, the old
Dissenting butterman, was so droll an event. Then he sank
down on his chair again with a sigh, the amusement dying out
all at once, purely superficial as it was. Amusement! how
strange that even the idea of amusement should enter his head
in the midst of his despair. His mind renewed that horrible
mechanical wandering through the dismal circle of might-be's
which still survived amid the chaos of his thoughts. Once or
twice there seemed to gleam upon him a stray glimmer of light
through a loophole, but only to throw him back again into the
darkness. Now and then he roused himself with a look of real
terror in his face, when there came a noise outside. What he
was afraid of was poor Cotsdean coming in with his hand to his
forehead, and his apologetic “Beg your pardon, sir.” If he
came, what could he say to him? Two days—only two days
more! If Mr. May had been less sensible and less courageous,
he would most likely have ended the matter by a pistol or a dose
of laudanum; but fortunately he was too rational to deliver
himself by this desperate expedient, which, of course, would
only have made the burden more terrible upon the survivors.
If Cotsdean was to be ruined, and there was no remedy, Mr. May
was man enough to feel that it was his business to stand by
him, not to escape in any dastardly way; but in the mean time
to face Cotsdean, and tell him that he had done and could
do nothing, seemed more than the man who had caused his ruin
could bear. He moved about uneasily in his chair in the anguish
of his mind. As he did so, he pushed off some of his
papers from the table with his elbow. It was some sort of
break in his feverish musings to pick them up again in a
bundle, without noticing what they were. He threw them
down in a little heap before him. On the top, as it chanced,
came the little dirty scrap of paper, which ought to have been
tossed into the fire or the waste-paper basket. Saml. Tozer!
What was Saml. Tozer to him that his name should stare him
in the face in this obtrusive way? Tozer, the old butterman!
a mean and ignorant person, as far beneath Mr. May's level as
it is possible to imagine, whose handwriting it was very strange
to see on anything but a bill. He fixed his eyes upon it mechanically;
he had come, as it were, to the end of all things in
those feverish musings; he had searched through his whole
known world for help, and found there nothing and nobody to
help him. Those whom he had once relied on were exhausted
long ago; his friends had all dropped off from him, as far, at
least, as money was concerned. Some of them might put out
a hand to keep him and his children from starvation even now,
but to pay Cotsdean's bill, never. There was no help anywhere,
nor any hope. Natural ways and means were all exhausted,
and though he was a clergyman, he had no such faith in the
supernatural as to hope much for the succour of Heaven.
Heaven! what could Heaven do for him? Bank-notes did not
drop down out of the skies. There had been a time when he
had felt full faith in “Providence;” but he seemed to have
nothing to expect now from that quarter more than from any
other. Samuel Tozer! why did that name always come uppermost,
staring into his very eyes? It was a curious signature,
the handwriting very rude and unrefined, with odd, illiterate
dashes, and yet with a kind of rough character in it, easy to
identify, not difficult to copy—</p>

<p>What was it that brought beads of moisture all at once to
Mr. May's forehead? He started up suddenly, pushing his
chair with a hoarse exclamation, and walked up and down the
room quickly, as if trying to escape from something. His heart
jumped up in his breast, like a thing possessed of separate life,
and thumped against his side, and beat with loud pulsations
in his ears. When he caught sight of himself in the mirror
over the mantelpiece, he started as if he had seen a ghost.
Some one else seemed to see him; seemed to pounce upon
and seize him out of that glass. He retreated from the reach
of it, almost staggering; then he returned to his table. What
thought was it that had struck him so wildly, like a sudden
squall upon a boat? He sat down, and covered his face with
his hands; then putting out one finger, stealthily drew the
paper towards him, and studied it closely from under the shadow
of the unmoved hand, which half-supported, half-covered his
face. Well! after all, what would be the harm? A gain of
three months' time, during which every sort of arrangement
could be made so nicely; supplies got anywhere, everywhere;
the whole machinery of being set easily in motion again, and
no harm done to any one: this was the real force of the idea—no
harm done to any one! Long before the three months were
out, that hundred pounds—a paltry business, a nothing, when
a man had time before him—could be got, one might make
sure; and where was the harm? <i>He</i> would never know it.
Poor Cotsdean need never have the slightest burden upon his
conscience. Here, in the stillness of his own room, it could
all be done as easily as possible, without a soul being taken
into confidence, except that bloodless wretch in the glass with
his staring face, Mr. May said to himself, only dimly sensible
that this wretch was himself. No, it would harm no one, that
was clear; it never need be known to any one. It was a mere
act of borrowing, and borrowing was never accounted a crime;
borrowing not money even, only a name, and for so short a time.
No harm; it could do no one in the world any harm.</p>

<p>While these reasonings went on in his mind, his heart dropped
down again into its right place; his pulse ceased to beat like
the pistons of a steam-engine; he came gradually to himself.
After all, what was it? Not such a great matter; a loan of
something which would neither enrich him who took, nor impoverish
him who, without being aware of it, should give—a
nothing! Why people should entertain the prejudices they did
on the subject, it was difficult to see, though, perhaps, he
allowed candidly to himself, it might be dangerous for any
ignorant man to follow the same strain of thinking; but in the
hands of a man who was not ignorant, who knew, as he himself
did, exactly how far to go, and what might be <i>innocently</i>
done; <i>innocently</i> done—in his own mind he put a great stress
on this—why, what was it? A thing which might be of use in
an emergency, and which was absolutely no harm.</p>

<p>Mr. May was late in leaving his room that night. It was
understood in the family that he “was writing,” and all was
kept very quiet in the house; yet not sufficiently quiet, for
Janey, when she brought in the coffee, placing it on the table
close to the door, was startled by the fierceness of the exclamation
with which her father greeted her entrance.</p>

<p>“What do you want prying here?” he said, dropping his
hand over the writing.</p>

<p>“Prying himself!” said Janey, furiously, when she was up
again in the cheerful light of the drawing-room; “a great deal
there is to pry into in that dreadful old study.”</p>

<p>“Hush! he never likes to be disturbed in his writing,” said
Ursula, soothingly.</p>

<p>And he sat at his “writing” to a much later hour than
usual, and he stumbled upstairs to his bed-room in the dead of
the night, with the same scared pale face which he had seen in
the glass. Such a look as that when it once comes upon a
man's face takes a long time to glide away; but his heart beat
more tranquilly, and the blood flowed even in his veins. After
all, where was the harm?</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIII"/>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h3>TIDED OVER.</h3>


<p>Next morning, Cotsdean was mournfully turning over his
ledger in the High Street, wondering whether he should go
back to Mr. May on another forlorn expedition, or whether he
should betray his overwhelming anxiety to his wife, who knew
nothing about the state of affairs. The shop was what is called
a corn-factor's shop, full of sacks of grain, with knots of wheat-ears
done up ornamentally in the window, a stock not very
valuable, but sufficient, and showing a good, if not a very important,
business. A young man behind, attended to what
little business was going on; for the master himself was too
much pre-occupied to think of bushels of seed. He was as uneasy
as Mr. May had been on the previous night, and in some
respects even more unhappy; for he had no resource except a
sort of dumb faith in his principle, a feeling that he must be
able to find out some way of escape—chequered by clouds of
despondency, sometimes approaching despair. For Cotsdean,
too, felt vaguely that things were approaching a crisis—that a
great many resources had been exhausted—that the pitcher
which had gone so often to the well must, at last, be broken,
and that it was as likely the catastrophe was coming now as at
any other time. He said to himself that never in his previous
experience had things seemed so blank as at present; never
had the moment of fate approached so nearly without any appearance
of deliverance. He had not even the round of possibilities
before him which were in Mr. May's mind, however
hopeless, at this particular moment, he might find them.</p>

<p>Cotsdean, for his part, had nothing to think of but Mr. May.
Would he find some way out of it still, he who was always so
clever, and must, in his position, have always “good friends?”
How the poor man wished that he had never been led into this
fatal course—that he had insisted, long ago, on the settlement
which must come some time, and which did not get any easier
by putting it off; but then, who was he to stand against
his clergyman? He did not feel able now to make any
stand against him. If he had to be ruined—he must be
ruined: what could he do? The man who had brought
him to this, held him in such subjection that he could not
denounce or accuse him even now. He was so much better,
higher, abler, stronger than himself, that Cotsdean's harshest
sentiment was a dumb feeling of injury; a feeling much
more likely to lead him to miserable tears than to resistance.
His clergyman—how was he to stand against his
clergyman? This was the burden of his thoughts. And still,
perhaps, there might be salvation and safety in the resources,
the power, and cleverness, and superior strength of the man
for whom, in his humility, he had risked everything. Poor Cotsdean's
eyes were red with sleeplessness and thinking, and the
constant rubbings he administered with the sleeve of his rough
coat. He hung helpless, in suspense, waiting to see what his
chief would say to him; if he would send for him—if he would
come. And in the intervals of these anxious thoughts, he
asked himself should he tell poor Sally—should he prepare her
for her fate? She and her children might be turned out of
house and home, very probably would be, he said to himself,
leaping to the extreme point, as men in his condition are apt
to do. They might take everything from him; they might
bring all his creditors on him in a heap; they might sell him
up; his shop by which he made his daily bread, and everything
he had, and turn his children out into the streets. Once more
he rubbed his sleeve over his eyes, which were smarting with
sleeplessness and easily-coming tears. He turned over the
pages of the ledger mechanically. There was no help in it—no
large debts owing to him that could be called in; no means
of getting any money; and nothing could he do but contemplate
the miseries that might be coming, and wait, wait, wondering
dully whether Mr. May was doing anything to avert this ruin,
and whether, at any moment, he might walk in, bringing safety
in the very look of his bold eyes. Cotsdean was not bold; he
was small and weakly, and nervous, and trembled at a sharp
voice. He was not a man adapted for vigorous struggling with
the world. Mr. May could do it, in whose hands was the final
issue. He was a man who was afraid of no one; and whose
powers nobody could deny. Surely now, even at the last
moment, he would find help somehow. It seemed profane to
entertain a doubt that he would be able to do it even at the
very last.</p>

<p>But Cotsdean had a miserable morning; he could do nothing.
Minute by minute, hour by hour, he waited to be called to the
Parsonage; now and then he went out to the door of his shop
and looked out wistfully down the street where it ended in the
distance of Grange Lane. Was that the maid from the Parsonage
coming up across the road? Were these the young
ladies, who, though they knew nothing about the matter at
issue, very frequently brought a note, or message, from their
father to Cotsdean? But he was deceived in these guesses as
well as in so many others. All the world seemed out of doors
that morning, but nobody came. The ruddy sunshine shone full
down the street, glorifying it with rays of warm gold, and
tinting the mists and clouds which lurked in the corners. It
had been heavy and overcast in the morning, but at noon the
clouds had cleared away, and that big red globe of fire had risen
majestically out of the mists, and everybody was out. But
no one, except humble people in the ordinary way of business,
came to Cotsdean. Bushels of grain for chickens, pennyworths
of canary seed—oh! did any one think he could pay a hundred
pounds out of these?—a hundred pounds, the spending of
which had not been his, poor man; which was indeed spent long
ago, and represented luxuries past and over, luxuries which
were not Cotsdean's. Strange that a mere lump of money
should live like this, long after it was, to all intents and purposes,
dead, and spent and gone!</p>

<p>Then came the hour of dinner, when his Sally called him to
the room behind the shop, from which an odour of bacon and
fine big beans—beans which were represented in his shop in
many a sackful. He went in unwillingly in obedience to her
command, but feeling unable to eat, soon left the table, sending
the young man to fill his place, with whose appetite no obstacle
of care or thought interfered. Poor Cotsdean felt that the
smell of the dinner made him sick—though he would have liked
to eat had he been able—the smell of the bacon which he loved,
and the sight of the small children whom he loved still better,
and poor Sally, his wife, still red in the face from dishing it up.
Sally was anxious about her husband's want of appetite.</p>

<p>“What ails you, John?” she said, pathetically; “it wasn't
as if you were out last night, nor nothing o' that sort. A man
as is sober like you don't ought to turn at his dinner.”</p>

<p>She was half sorry, and half aggrieved, poor woman, feeling
as if some blame of her cookery must be involved.</p>

<p>“It's the bile,” said poor Cotsdean, with that simplicity of
statement which is common in his class. “Don't you take on,
Sally, I'll be a deal better by supper-time——or worse,” he
added to himself. Yes, he would make an effort to eat at
supper-time; perhaps it might be the last meal he should eat
in his own comfortable home.</p>

<p>He had been out at the shop door, gazing despairingly down
the road; he had come in and sold some birdseed, wondering—oh,
what good would that penny do him?—he who wanted a
hundred pounds? and was standing listening with a sad heart
to the sound of the knives and forks and chatter of the children,
when suddenly all at once Mr. May walked into the shop,
changing dismay into hope. What a thing it was to be a
gentleman and a clergyman. Cotsdean could not but think!
The very sight of Mr. May inspired him with courage; even
though probably he had no money in his pocket, it was a supporting
thing only to see him, and hear the sound of his free
unrestrained step. He came in with a friendly nod to his
humble helper; then he glanced round the shop, to see that no
one was present, and then he said, “All right, Cotsdean,” in a
voice that was as music to the little corn-factor's ears. His
heart, which had been beating so low, jumped up in his bosom;
his appetite came back with a leap; he asked himself would
the bacon be cold? and cried, “God be praised, sir,” in a
breath.</p>

<p>Mr. May winced slightly; but why should it be wrong to be
grateful to God in any circumstances? he asked himself, having
become already somewhat composed in his ideas on this particular
point.</p>

<p>“Are we quite alone?” he said. “Nobody within hearing?
I have not brought you the money, but a piece of paper that
is as good as the money. Take it: you will have no difficulty
in discounting this; the man is as well known as the Carlingford
Bank, and as safe, though I dare say you will be surprised
at the name.”</p>

<p>Cotsdean opened out the new bill with trembling hands.
“Tozer!” he said faintly, between relief and dismay.</p>

<p>“Yes. You must know that I am taking a pupil—one who
belongs to a very rich Dissenting family in London. Tozer
knows something about him, from his connection with the
body, and through this young man I have got to know something
of <i>him</i>. He does it upon the admirable security of the
fees I am to receive with this youth; so you see, after all, there
is no mystery about it. Better not wait for to-morrow,
Cotsdean. Go at once, and get it settled. You see,” said Mr.
May, ingratiatingly, “it is a little larger than the other—one
hundred and fifty, indeed—but that does not matter with such
an excellent name.”</p>

<p>“Tozer!” said Cotsdean, once more bewildered. He handled
the piece of paper nervously, and turned it upside down, and
round about, with a sense that it might melt in his hold. He
did not like the additional fifty added. Why should another
fifty be added? but so it was, and there seemed nothing for
him but to take the immediate relief and be thankful.</p>

<p>“I'd rather, sir, as Tozer hadn't known nothing about it;
and why should he back a bill for me as ain't one of my friends,
nor don't know nothing about me? and fifty more added on,”
said Cotsdean. It was the nearest he had gone to standing up
against his clergyman; he did not like it. To be Mr. May's
sole stand-by and agent, even at periodical risk of ruin, was
possible to him; but a pang of jealousy, alarm, and pain came
into his mind when he saw the new name. This even obliterated
the immediate sense of relief that was in his mind.</p>

<p>“Come three months it'll have to be paid,” said Cotsdean,
“and Tozer ain't a man to stand it if he's left to pay; he'd sell
us up, Mr. May. He ain't one of the patient ones, like—some
other folks; and there's fifty pounds put on. I don't see my
way to it. I'd rather it was just the clear hundred, if it was
the same to you.”</p>

<p>“It is not the same to me,” said Mr. May, calmly. “Come,
there is no cause to make any fuss. There it is, and if you
don't like to make use of it, you must find some better way.
Bring the fifty pounds, less the expenses, to me to-night. It
is a good bit of paper, and it delivers us out of a mess which
I hope we shall not fall into again.”</p>

<p>“So you said before, sir,” said the corn-factor sullenly.</p>

<p>“Cotsdean, you forget yourself; but I can make allowance
for your anxiety. Take it, and get it settled before the bank
closes; pay in the money to meet the other bill, and bring
me the balance. You will find no difficulty with Tozer's name;
and what so likely as that one respectable tradesman should
help another? By the way, the affair is a private one between
us, and it is unnecessary to say anything to him about it; the
arrangement, you understand, is between him and me.”</p>

<p>“Beg your pardon, sir,” said Cotsdean, with a deprecatory
movement of his hand to his forehead; “but it is me as will be
come upon first if anything happens, and that fifty pounds—”</p>

<p>“Have you ever found me to fail you, Cotsdean? If you
knew the anxiety I have gone through, that you might be kept
from harm, the sleepless nights, the schemes, the exertions!
You may suppose it was no ordinary effort to ask a man like
Tozer.”</p>

<p>Cotsdean was moved by the touching tone in which his partner
in trouble spoke; but terror gave him a certain power.
He grumbled still, not altogether vanquished.</p>

<p>“I don't say nothing against that, sir,” he said, not meeting
Mr. May's eye; “but when it comes to be paid, sir, I'm the
first in it, and where is that other fifty to come from? That's
what I'm a thinking for—for I'm the first as they'd haul up
after all.”</p>

<p>“You!” said Mr. May, “what could they get from you?
You are not worth powder and shot. Don't be ridiculous, my
good fellow. I never avoid my responsibilities, as you know.
I am as good, I hope, for that fifty as for all that went before.
Have you ever known me leave you or any one in the
lurch?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I can't say as—I don't suppose I have. I've
always put my trust in you like in Providence itself,” he cried,
hastily, holding his breath.</p>

<p>“Then do as I tell you,” said Mr. May, waving his hand
with careless superiority; and though his heart was aching with
a hundred anxious fears, he left the shop with just that mixture
of partial offence and indifference which overawed completely
his humble retainer. Cotsdean trembled at his own guilty
folly and temerity. He did not dare to call his patron back
again, to ask his pardon. He did not venture to go back to the
table and snatch a bit of cold bacon. He was afraid he had
offended his clergyman, what matter that he was hungry for
his dinner? He called the young man from the bacon, which
was now cold and all but eaten up, and snatched at his hat and
went out to the bank. It was all he could do.</p>

<h3>A VISIT.</h3>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear May</span>,</p>

<p>“Young Copperhead, the young fellow whom you have undertaken
to coach, is coming to the Hall for a few days before
he enters upon his studies, and Anne wishes me to ask you
to come over on Tuesday to dine and sleep, and to make acquaintance
with him. You can carry him back with you if it
suits you. In my private opinion, he is a cub of the most disagreeable
kind; but the girls like his mother, who is a kind of
cousin, as you know. It is not only because he has failed to
take his degree (you know how I hate the hideous slang in
which this fact is generally stated), but that his father, who is
one of the rich persons who abound in the lower circles of
society, is ambitious, and would like to see him in Parliament,
and that sort of thing—a position which cannot be held creditably
without some sort of education: at least, so I am myself
disposed to think. Therefore, your pleasing duty will be to
get him up in a little history and geography, so that he may
not get quite hopelessly wrong in any of the modern modifications
of territory, for instance; and in so much Horace as may
furnish him with a few stock quotations, in case he should be
called upon, in the absence of any more hopeful neophyte, to
move the Address. He is a great hulking fellow, not very
brilliant, you may suppose, but not so badly mannered as he
might be, considering his parentage. I don't think he'll give
you much trouble in the house; but he will most probably bore
you to death, and in that case your family ought to have a claim,
I should think, for compensation. Anyhow, come and see him,
and us, before you begin your hard task.</p>

<div class="xhtml_center">“Very truly yours,</div>
<p style="text-align: right;">“<span class="smcap">R. Dorset.</span>”</p>

<p>“Anne makes me open my letter to say that Ursula must
come too. We will send a carriage to meet you at the station.”</p></div>

<p>This letter caused considerable excitement in the Parsonage.
It was the first invitation to dinner which Ursula had ever
received. The dinner-parties in Carlingford were little frequented
by young ladies. The male population was not large
enough to afford a balance for the young women of the place,
who came together in the evening, and took all the trouble of
putting on their pretty white frocks, only to sit in rows in the
drawing-room, waiting till the old gentlemen came in from the
dining-room, after which everybody went away. There were
no young gentlemen to speak of in Carlingford, so that when
any one was bold enough to attempt a dancing-party, or anything
of an equally amusing description, friends were sent out
in all directions, as the beaters are sent into the woods to
bring together the unfortunate birds for a <i>battue</i>, to find men.
These circumstances will explain the flutter in Ursula's innocent
bosom when her father read her that postscript. Mr.
May was singularly amiable that day, a thing which happened
at periodical intervals, usually after he had been specially
“cross.” On this occasion there was no black mark against
him in the family reckoning, and yet he was more kind than
any one had ever known him. Instead of making any objections,
he decided at once that Ursula must go, and told her to
put on her prettiest frock, and make herself look very nice.</p>

<p>“You must let Anne Dorset see that you care to please her,”
he said. “Anne is a very good woman, and her approval is
worth having.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa!” cried Janey, “when you are always calling her
an old maid!”</p>

<p>“L'un n'empêche pas l'autre,” he said, which puzzled Janey,
whose French was very deficient. Even Ursula, supposed to
be the best French scholar in the family, was not quite sure
what it meant; but it was evidently something in favour of
Cousin Anne, which was sweet to the grateful girl.</p>

<p>Janey, though suffering bitterly under the miserable consciousness
of being only fourteen, and not asked anywhere,
helped with disinterested zeal to get her sister ready, and consoled
herself by orders for unlimited muffins and cake for tea.</p>

<p>“There will only be the children,” she said, resignedly, and
felt herself <i>incomprise</i>; but indeed, the attractions of a good
romp afterwards, no one being in the house to restrain the
spirits of the youthful party, made even Janey amends.</p>

<p>As for Reginald, who was not asked, he was, it must be
allowed, rather sulky too, and he could not solace himself
either with muffins or romps. His rooms at the College were
very pleasant rooms, but he was used to home; and though
the home at the Parsonage was but faded, and not in such perfect
order as it might have been, the young man felt even his
wainscoted study dull without the familiar voices, the laughter
and foolish family jokes, and even the little quarrels which
kept life always astir. He walked with Ursula to the station,
whither her little box with her evening dress had gone before
her, in a half-affronted state of mind.</p>

<p>“What does he want with a pupil?” Reginald was saying,
as he had said before. “A fellow no one knows, coming and
taking possession of the house as if it belonged to him. There
is plenty to do in the parish without pupils, and if I were not
on the spot he would get into trouble, I can tell you. A man
that has been ploughed, 'a big hulking fellow' (Sir Robert
says so, not I). Mind, I'll have no flirting, Ursula; that is
what always happens with a pupil in the house.”</p>

<p>“Reginald, how dare you—”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I dare; my courage is quite equal to facing you,
even if you do shoot thunderbolts out of your eyes. Mind
you, I won't have it. There is a set of fellows who try it
regularly, and if you were above them, would go in for Janey;
and it would be great fun and great promotion for Janey; she
would feel herself a woman directly; so you must mind her as
well as yourself. I don't like it at all,” Reginald went on.
“Probably he will complain of the dinners you give him, as
if he were in an inn. Confound him! What my father
means by it, I can't tell.”</p>

<p>“Reginald, you ought not to swear,” said Ursula. “It is
dreadfully wicked in a clergyman. Poor papa meant making a
little more money. What else could he mean? And I think
it is very good of him, for it will bother him most. Mr. Copperhead
is very nice, Reginald. I saw him in London, you
know. I thought he was very——”.</p>

<p>“Ah! oh!” said Reginald, “I forgot that. You met him in
London? To be sure, and it was there you met Miss
Beecham. I begin to see. Is he coming here after her, I
should like to know? She doesn't look the sort of girl to
encourage that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“The sort of girl to encourage that sort of thing! How
strangely you talk when you get excited: isn't that rather
vulgar? I don't know if he is coming after Miss Beecham or
not,” said Ursula, who thought the suggestion uncalled for,
“but in a very short time you can judge for yourself.”</p>

<p>“Ah—indignation!” said the big brother, who like most
big brothers laughed at Ursula's exhibition of offended dignity;
“and, by the way, Miss Beecham—you have not seen her since
that night when she was sent for. Will not she think it
strange that you never sent to inquire?”</p>

<p>“I sent Betsey—”</p>

<p>“But if Miss Beecham had been somebody else, you would
have gone yourself,” he said, being in a humour for finding
fault. “If poor old Mrs. Tozer had been what you call a
lady—”</p>

<p>“I thought you were much more strong than I am against
the Dissenters?” said Ursula, “ever since that man's speech;
and, indeed, always, as long as I can recollect.”</p>

<p>“She is not a mere Dissenter,” said Reginald. “I think I
shall call as I go home. She is the cleverest girl I ever met;
not like one of you bread-and-butter girls, though she is not
much older than you. A man finds a girl like that worth talking
to,” said the young clergyman, holding himself erect.
Certainly Reginald had not improved; he had grown ever so
much more self-important since he got a living of his own.</p>

<p>“And if I was to say, 'Mind, I won't have it, Reginald?'”
cried Ursula, half-laughing, half-angry. “I think that is a
great deal worse than a pupil. But Miss Beecham is very
dignified, and you may be sure she will not think much of a
call from you. Heaven be praised! that is one thing you can't
get into your hands; we girls are always good for something
there. Men may think themselves as grand as they please,”
said Ursula, “but their visits are of no consequence; it is
ladies of the family who must <i>call</i>!” After this little out-break,
she came down at once to her usual calm. “I will ask
Cousin Anne what I ought to do; I don't think Miss Beecham
wanted me to go then—”</p>

<p>“I shall go,” said Reginald, and he left Ursula in her
father's keeping, who met them at the station, and went off at
once, with a pleasant sense of having piqued her curiosity, to
Grange Lane.</p>

<p>It was still early, for the trains which stopped at the little
country station next to the Hall were very few and inconvenient,
and the sun, though setting, was still shining red from over
St. Roque's upon Grange Lane. The old red walls grew
redder still in the frosty night, and the sky began to bloom
into great blazing patches of colour upon the wintry clearness
of the blue. There was going to be a beautiful sunset, and
such a thing was always to be seen from Grange Lane better
than anywhere else in Carlingford. Reginald went down the
road slowly, looking at it, and already almost forgetting his idea
of calling on Miss Beecham. To call on Miss Beecham would
be to call on old Tozer, the butterman, to whom alone the visit
would be naturally paid; and this made him laugh within himself.
So he would have passed, no doubt, without the least attempt
at intruding on the privacy of the Tozers, had not the
garden-door opened before he got so far, and Phœbe herself
came out, with her hands in her muff, to take a little walk up
and down as she did daily. She did not take her hand out of
its warm enclosure to give it to him; but nodded with friendly
ease in return to his salutation.</p>

<p>“I have come out to see the sunset,” said Phœbe; “I like
a little air before the day is over, and grandmamma, when she
is poorly, likes her room to be very warm.”</p>

<p>“I hope Mrs. Tozer is better. I hope you have not been
anxious.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! it is chronic; there is no danger. But she requires
a great deal of attendance; and I like to come out when
I can. Oh, how fine it is! what colour! I think, Mr. May,
you must have a <i>spécialité</i> for sunsets at Carlingford. I never
saw them so beautiful anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“I am glad there is something you like in Carlingford.”</p>

<p>“Something! there is a very great deal; and that I don't
like too,” she said with a smile. “I don't care for the people
I am living among, which is dreadful. I don't suppose you
have ever had such an experience, though you must know a great
deal more in other ways than I. All the people that come to
inquire about grandmamma are very kind; they are as good as
possible; I respect them, and all that, but——Well, it must
be my own fault, or education. It is education, no doubt, that
gives us those absurd ideas.”</p>

<p>“Don't call them absurd,” said Reginald, “indeed I can enter
into them perfectly well. I don't <i>know</i> them, perhaps, in my own
person; but I can perfectly understand the repugnance, the
distress—”</p>

<p>“The words are too strong,” said Phœbe, “not so much as
that; the—annoyance, perhaps, the nasty disagreeable struggle
with one's self and one's pride; as if one were better than
other people. I dislike myself, and despise myself for it; but
I can't help it. We have so little power over ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will let my sister do what she can to deliver
you,” said Reginald; “Ursula is not like you; but she is a good
little thing, and she is able to appreciate you. I was to tell you
she had been called suddenly off to the Dorsets', with whom my
father and she have gone to pass the night—to meet, I believe,
a person you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Clarence Copperhead; he is come then? How odd it
will be to see him here. His mother is nice, but his father is——Oh,
Mr. May! if you only knew the things people have
to put up with. When I think of Mr. Copperhead, and his
great, ugly, staring wealth, I feel disposed to hate money—especially
among Dissenters. It would be better if we were all
poor.”</p>

<p>Reginald said nothing; he thought so too. In that case
there would be a few disagreeable things out of a poor clergyman's
way, and assaults like that of Northcote upon himself
would be impossible; but he could scarcely utter these virtuous
sentiments.</p>

<p>“Poverty is the desire of ascetics, and this is not an ascetic age,”
he said at length, with a half-laugh at himself for his stiff speech.</p>

<p>“You may say it is not an ascetic age; but yet I suppose
the Ritualists——. Perhaps you are a Ritualist yourself, Mr.
May? I know as little personally about the church here, as
you do about Salem Chapel. I like the service—so does papa—and
I like above all things the independent standing of a
clergyman; the feeling he must have that he is free to do his
duty. That is why I like the church; for other things of course
I like our own body best.”</p>

<p>“I don't suppose such things can be argued about, Miss
Beecham. I wish I knew something of my father's new pupil.
I don't like having a stranger in the house; my father is fond of
having his own way.”</p>

<p>“It is astonishing how often parents are so,” said Phœbe,
demurely; “and the way they talk of their experience! as if
each new generation did not know more than the one that
preceded it.”</p>

<p>“You are pleased to laugh, but I am quite in earnest. A
pupil is a nuisance. For instance, no man who has a family
should ever take one. I know what things are said.”</p>

<p>“You mean about the daughters? That is true enough,
there are always difficulties in the way; but you need not be
afraid of Clarence Copperhead. He is not the fascinating pupil
of a church-novel. There's nothing the least like the Heir of
Redclyffe about him.”</p>

<p>“You are very well up in Miss Yonge's novels, Miss
Beecham.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Phœbe; “one reads Scott for Scotland (and a
few other things), and one reads Miss Yonge for the church.
Mr. Trollope is good for that too, but not so good. All that
I know of clergymen's families I have got from her. I can
recognize you quite well, and your sister, but the younger ones
puzzle me; they are not in Miss Yonge; they are too much
like other children, too naughty. I don't mean anything
disagreeable. The babies in Miss Yonge are often very naughty
too, but not the same. As for you, Mr. May——”</p>

<p>“Yes. As for me?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know everything about you. You are a fine scholar,
but you don't like the drudgery of teaching. You have a fine
mind, but it interferes with you continually. You have had a
few doubts—just enough to give a piquancy; and now you have
a great ideal, and mean to do many things that common clergymen
don't think of. That was why you hesitated about the
chaplaincy? See how much I have got out of Miss Yonge.
I know you as well as if I had known you all my life; a great
deal better than I know Clarence Copperhead; but then, no
person of genius has taken any trouble about him.”</p>

<p>“I did not know I had been a hero of fiction,” said Reginald,
who had a great mind to be angry. All this time they were
walking briskly backward and forward before Tozer's open door,
the Anglican, in his long black coat, following the lively movements
of Tozer's granddaughter, only because he could not
help himself. He was irritated, yet he was pleased. A young
man is pleased to be thought of, even when the notice is but
barely complimentary. Phœbe must have thought of him a
good deal before she found him out in this way; but he was
irritated all the same.</p>

<p>“You are, however,” she answered lightly. “Look at that
blaze of crimson, Mr. May; and the blue which is so clear and
so unfathomable. Winter is grander than summer, and even
warmer—to look at; with its orange, and purple, and gold.
What poor little dirty, dingy things we are down here, to have
all this exhibited every evening for our delight!”</p>

<p>“That is true,” he said; and as he gazed, something woke
in the young man's heart—a little thrill of fancy, if not of love.
It is hard to look at a beautiful sunset, and then see it reflected
in a girl's face, and not to feel something—which may be nothing,
perhaps. His heart gave a small jump, not much to speak of.
Phœbe did not talk like the other young ladies in Grange
Lane.</p>

<p>“Mr. May, Mr. May!” she cried suddenly, “please go away!
I foresee a disastrous encounter which alarms me. You can't
fight, but there is no saying what you might do to each other.
Please go away!”</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” he said. “I don't understand any
encounter being disastrous here. Why should I go away?”</p>

<p>She laughed, but there was a certain fright in her tone.
“Please!” she said, “I see Mr. Northcote coming this way.
He will stop to speak to me. It is the gentleman who attacked
you in the Meeting. Mr. May,” she added entreatingly, between
laughter and fright, “do go, please.”</p>

<p>“I shall do nothing of the kind,” said Reginald, roused; “I
am not afraid. Let him come on. This wall shall fly from its
firm base as soon as I.”</p>

<p>Phœbe clasped her hands in dismay, which was partially real.
“The typical churchman,” she said, with a glance at Reginald's
figure, which was not displeasing to him, “and the typical Dissenter!
and what am I to do between them? Oh, I wish you
would go away.”</p>

<p>“Not an inch,” said the young champion. Phœbe was
frightened, but she was delighted. “I shall introduce him to
you,” she said threatening.</p>

<p>“I don't mind,” he replied; “nothing on earth should induce
me to fly.”</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXV"/>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>TEA.</h3>


<p>Now here was a business! The typical Anglican and the
typical Dissenter, as Phœbe said, with only that clever young
woman to keep them from flying at each other's throats; the
one obstinately holding his place by her side (and Phœbe began
to have a slight consciousness that, being without any chaperon,
she ought not to have kept Reginald May at her side; but in
the Tozer world, who knew anything of chaperons?), the other
advancing steadily, coming up the Lane out of the glow of the
sunset, showing square against it in his frock-coat and high hat,
formal and demagogical, not like his rival. The situation
pleased Phœbe, who liked to “manage;” but it slightly
frightened her as well, though the open door behind, and the
long garden with its clouds of crocuses, was a city of refuge
always within reach.</p>

<p>“Is it really you, Mr. Northcote?” she said. “You look
as if you had dropped out of that lovely sunset I have been
watching so long—and I thought you were at the other end of
the world.”</p>

<p>“I have been at the other end of England, which comes to
the same thing,” said Northcote, in a voice which was harsh by
nature, and somewhat rough with cold; “and now they have
sent me back to Salem Chapel, to take Mr. Thorpe's place for
three months. They asked for me, I believe; but that you
must know better than I do.”</p>

<p>It was not in the nature of man not to be a little proud in the
circumstances, and it is quite possible that he considered
Phœbe to have something to do with the flattering request.</p>

<p>“No, I have not heard; but I am glad,” said Phœbe; “and
if it is not wicked to say so, I am glad Mr. Thorpe is to be
away. Let us hope it will do him good. I am sure it will do
the rest of us good, at all events.”</p>

<p>Northcote made no answer; but he looked at the other, and
several questions began to tremble on his lips. That this was
a Churchman did not immediately occur to him; for, indeed,
various young pastors of his own body put on the livery which
he himself abjured, and the sight of it as a servile copy filled
him with a certain contempt.</p>

<p>“Mr. May has been stopped in his way by the beauty of the
skies,” said Phœbe, rather enjoying the position as she got used
to it. “Mr. Northcote—Mr. May. It is not easy to pass
such an exhibition as that, is it?—and given to us all for love,
and nothing for reward,” she added; for she was a well read
young woman, and did not hesitate to suffer this to appear.</p>

<p>And then there was a momentary pause. Northcote was
confused, it must be allowed, by thus coming face to face, without
previous warning, with the man whom he had so violently
assailed. Reginald had the best of it in every way, for he was
the man injured, and had it in his power to be magnanimous;
and he had the advantage of full warning, and had prepared
himself. Besides, was not he the superior by every social rule?
And that consciousness is always sweet.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Northcote is new to Carlingford, he will probably
not know what a fine point of view we have here. That, like
so many other things,” said Reginald, pointedly, “wants a little
personal experience to find it out.”</p>

<p>“For that matter, to see it once is as good as seeing it a
hundred times,” said Northcote, somewhat sharply; for to give
in was the very last thing he thought of. A little glow of anger
came over him. He thought Phœbe had prepared this ordeal
for him, and he was vexed, not only because she had done it,
but because his sense of discomfiture might afford a kind of
triumph to that party in the connection which was disposed, as
he expressed it, to “toady the Church.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, I don't think you can judge of anything at a
first view.”</p>

<p>“And, pardon me, I think you see everything most sharply
and clearly at a first view,” said the Nonconformist, who was
the loudest; “certainly in all matters of principle. After a
while, you are persuaded against your will to modify this opinion
and that, to pare off a little here, and tolerate a little there.
Your first view is the most correct.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Phœbe, throwing herself into the breach, “I
am glad you don't agree, for the argument is interesting. Will
you come in and fight it out? You shall have some tea, which
will be pleasant, for it shall be hot. I really cannot stay out
any longer; it is freezing here.”</p>

<p>The new-comer prepared to follow; but Reginald hesitated.
Pride whispered that to go into the house of Tozer, the butterman,
was something monstrous; but then it might be amusing.
This “Dissenting fellow,” no doubt, was a drawback; but a
kind of angry antagonism and disdain half-attracted him even
to the Dissenting fellow. It might be well, on the whole, to
see what kind of being such a person was. All curious
phenomena are attractive to a student. “The proper study of
mankind is man,” Reginald said to himself. Before he had
got through this little argument with himself, Phœbe had gone
in, and Northcote, whose disgust at the interposition of an adversary
had no such softening of curiosity, followed her abruptly,
without any of those graces which are current in society.
This rudeness offended the other, who was about to walk on
indignant, when Phœbe turned back, and looked out at him
from the open door.</p>

<p>“Are not you coming, Mr. May?” she said softly, looking
at him with the least little shrug of her shoulders.</p>

<p>Reginald yielded without further resistance. But he felt
fully that to see him, the chaplain of the old College, walking
down through Tozer's garden, between the two rows of closed-up
crocuses which glimmered ghostly by the side of the path,
was one of the strangest sights in the world.</p>

<p>Phœbe, to tell the truth, was a little confused as to where to
convey her captive, out of whom she meant to get a little amusement
for the long winter afternoon. For a girl of her active
mind, it may easily be imagined that a succession of long days
with Mrs. Tozer was somewhat monotonous. She did her duty
like a hero, and never complained; but still, if a little amusement
was possible, it was worth having. She carried in her two
young men as naughty boys carry stag-beetles, or other such
small deer. If they would fight it would be fun; and if they
would not fight, why, it might be fun still, and more amusing
than grandmamma. She hesitated between the chilly drawing-room,
where a fire was lighted, but where there was no evidence
of human living, and the cozy parlour, where Mrs. Tozer sat
in her best cap, still wheezy, but convalescent, waiting for her
tea, and not indisposed to receive such deputations of the community
as might come to ask for her. Finally, Phœbe opened
the door of that sanctuary, which was dazzling with bright fire-light
after the gloom outside. It was a very comfortable
interior, arranged by Phœbe to suit her own ideas rather than
those of grandmamma, though grandmamma's comfort had been
her chief object. The tea-things were sparkling upon the table,
the kettle singing by the fire, and Mrs. Tozer half-dozing in
the tranquillity and warmth.</p>

<p>“Grandmamma, I have brought Mr. May and Mr. Northcote
to see you,” she said.</p>

<p>The poor old lady almost sprang from her chair in amazement.</p>

<p>“Lord bless us, Phœbe, Mr. May!”</p>

<p>“Don't disturb yourself, grandmamma; they will find seats.
Yes, we were all looking at the sunset, and as I knew tea must
be ready—I know you want it, dear granny—I asked them to
have some. Here it is, as I told you, quite hot, and very
fragrant this cold night. How cold it is outside! I think it
will freeze, and that skating may come off at last, Mr. May,
that you were talking of, you remember? You were to teach
your sisters to skate.”</p>

<p>“Yes, with the advantage of your example.”</p>

<p>Reginald had put himself in a corner, as far away as possible
from the old woman in the chair. His voice, he felt, had caught
a formal tone. As for the other, his antagonist, he had assumed
the front of the battle—even, in Tozer's absence, he had ventured
to assume the front of the fire. He was not the sort of man
Reginald had expected, almost hoped to see—a fleshy man,
loosely put together, according to the nature, so far as he knew
it, of Dissenters; but a firmly knit, clean-limbed young man,
with crisp hair curling about his head, and a gleam of energy
and spirit in his eye. The gentler Anglican felt by no means
sure of a speedy victory, even of an intellectual kind. The
young man before him did not look a slight antagonist. They
glared at each other, measuring their strength; they did not
know, indeed, that they had been brought in here to this warmth
and light, like the stag-beetles, to make a little amusement for
Phœbe; but they were quite ready to fight all the same.</p>

<p>“Mr. Northcote, sir, I'm glad to see you. Now this is
friendly; this is what I calls as it should be, when a young
pastor comes in and makes free, without waiting for an invitation,”
said Tozer kindly, bustling in; “that speech of yours,
sir, was a rouser; that 'it 'em off, that did, and you can see as
the connection ain't ungrateful. What's that you say, Phœbe?
what? I'm a little hard of hearing. Mr.—May!”</p>

<p>“Mr. May was good enough to come in with me, grandpapa.
We met at the door. We have mutual friends, and you know
how kind Miss May has been,” said Phœbe, trembling with
sudden fright, while Reginald, pale with rage and embarrassment,
stood up in his corner. Tozer was embarrassed too.
He cleared his throat and rubbed his hands, with a terrible
inclination to raise one of them to his forehead. It was all
that he could do to get over this class instinct. Young May,
though he had been delighted to hear him assailed in the
Meeting, was a totally different visitor from the clever young
pastor whom he received with a certain consciousness of patronage.
Tozer did not know that the Northcotes were infinitely
richer, and quite as well-born and well-bred in their ways as
the Mays, and that his young Dissenting brother was a more
costly production, as well as a more wealthy man, than the
young chaplain in his long coat; but if he had known this it
would have made no difference. His relation to the one was
semi-servile, to the other condescending and superior. In
Reginald May's presence, he was but a butterman who supplied
the family; but to Horace Northcote he was an influential
member of society, with power over a Minister's individual
fate.</p>

<p>“I assure you, sir, as I'm proud to see you in my house,”
he said, with a duck of his head, and an ingratiating but uncomfortable
smile. “Your father, I hope, as he's well, sir,
and all the family? We are a kind of neighbours now; not
as we'd think of taking anything upon us on account of living
in Grange Lane. But Phœbe here—Phœbe, junior, as we call's
her—she's a cut above us, and I'm proud to see any of her
friends in my 'umble 'ouse. My good lady, sir,” added Tozer,
with another duck, indicating with a wave of his hand his wife,
who had already once risen, wheezy, but knowing her manners,
to make a kind of half-bow, half-curtsey from her chair.</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” said Reginald, feeling himself blush
furiously, and not knowing what to say. The other young
man stood with his back to the fire, and a sneer, which he intended
to look like a smile, on his face.</p>

<p>And as for Phœbe, it must be allowed that, notwithstanding
all her resources, even she was exquisitely uncomfortable for
a minute or two. The young people all felt this, but to Tozer
it seemed that he had managed everything beautifully, and a
sense of elation stole over him. To be visited in this manner
by the gentry, “making free,” and “quite in a friendly way,”
was an honour he had never looked for. He turned to Northcote
with great affability and friendliness.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “Mr. Northcote, sir, it can't be denied as
this is a strange meeting; you and Mr. May, as mightn't be,
perhaps, just the best of friends, to meet quite comfortable over
a cup of tea. But ain't it the very best thing that could
happen? Men has their public opinions, sir, as every one
should speak up bold for, and stick to; that's my way of
thinking. But I wouldn't bring it no farther; not, as might
be said, into the domestic circle. I'm clean against that.
You say your say in public, whatever you may think on a
subject, but you don't bear no malice; it ain't a personal
question; them's my sentiments. And I don't know nothing
more elevatin', nothing more consolin', than for two public
opponents, as you may say, to meet like this quite cozy and
comfortable over a cup o' tea.”</p>

<p>“It is a pleasure, I assure you, which I appreciate highly,”
said Reginald, finding his voice.</p>

<p>“And which fills me with delight and satisfaction,” said
Northcote. Those stag-beetles which Phœbe, so to speak, had
carried in in her handkerchief, were only too ready to fight.</p>

<p>“You had better have some tea first,” she said breathless,
“before you talk so much of its good effects. Sit down, grandpapa,
and have your muffin while it is hot; I know that is
what you like. Do you care about china, Mr. May? but
every one cares for china now-a-days. Look at that cup, and
fancy grandmamma having this old service in use without
knowing how valuable it is. Cream Wedgwood! You may
fancy how I stared when I saw it; and in everyday use! most
people put it up on brackets, when they are so lucky as to
possess any. Tell Mr. May, grandmamma, how you picked it
up. Mr. Northcote, there is an article in this review that I
want you to look at. Papa sent it to me. It is too metaphysical
for me, but I know you are great in metaphysics—”</p>

<p>“I am greater in china; may not I look at the Wedgwood
first?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will turn over the literature to me,” said Reginald,
“reviews are more in my way than teacups, though I say
it with confusion. I know how much I am behind my age.”</p>

<p>“And I too,” whispered Phœbe, behind the book which she
had taken up. “Don't tell any one. It is rare, I know; and
everybody likes to have something that is rare; but I don't
really care for it the least in the world. I have seen some bits
of Italian <i>faience</i> indeed—but English pottery is not like Italian,
any more than English skies.”</p>

<p>“You have the advantage of me, Miss Beecham, both as regards
the pottery and the skies.”</p>

<p>“Ah, if it is an advantage; bringing poetry down to prose is
not always an advantage, is it? Italy is such a dream—so long
as one has never been there.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a dream,” said Reginald, with enthusiasm, “to
everybody, I think; but when one has little money and much
work all one's life—poverty stands in the way of all kinds of
enjoyment.”</p>

<p>“Poverty is a nice friendly sort of thing; a ground we can
all meet on,” said Phœbe. “But don't let us say that to
grandpapa. How odd people are! he knows you are not
Crœsus, but still he has a sort of feeling that you are a young
prince, and do him the greatest honour in coming to his house;
and yet, all the same, he thinks that money is the very grandest
thing in existence. See what prejudice is! He would not
allow that he had any class-reverence, and yet he can no more
get rid of it—”</p>

<p>“Miss Beecham, it is very difficult for me to say anything on
such a subject.”</p>

<p>“Very difficult, and you show your delicacy by not saying
anything. But you know, apart from this, which is not gratifying,
I am rather proud of grandpapa's way of looking at some
things. About saying out your opinions in public, and yet bearing
no malice, for instance. Now, Mr. Northcote is the very
Antipodes to you; therefore you ought to know him and find
out what he means. It would be better for you both. That
is what I call enlarging the mind,” said Phœbe with a smile;
which was, to tell the truth, a very pretty smile, and filled with
a soft lustre the blue eyes with which she looked at him.
Whether it was this, or the cogency of her argument, that
moved the young Anglican, it would be hard to say.</p>

<p>“If you are to be the promoter of this new science, I don't
object to studying under you,” he said with a great deal of
meaning in his voice.</p>

<p>Phœbe gave him another smile, though she shook her head;
and then she turned to the hero on the other side.</p>

<p>“Is it genuine, Mr. Northcote? is it as fine as I thought?
There now, I told you, grandmamma! Have you been telling
Mr. Northcote how you picked it up? I am sure you will
present him with a cup and saucer for his collection in return
for his praises.”</p>

<p>“Not for the world,” said Northcote, with profound seriousness;
“break a set of cream Wedgwood! what do you take me
for, Miss Beecham? I don't mean to say that I would not give
my ears to have it—all; but to break the set—”</p>

<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon! I was not prepared for such delicacy
of feeling—such conscientiousness—”</p>

<p>“Ah!” said Northcote, with a long-drawn breath, “I don't
think you can understand the feelings of an enthusiast. A set
of fine China is like a poem—every individual bit is necessary
to the perfection of the whole. I allow that this is not the
usual way of looking at it; but my pleasure lies in seeing it
entire, making the tea-table into a kind of lyric, elevating the
family life by the application of the principles of abstract beauty
to its homeliest details. Pardon, Miss Beecham, but Mrs.
Tozer is right, and you are wrong. The idea of carrying off a
few lines of a poem in one's pocket for one's collection—”</p>

<p>“Now that's what I call speaking up,” said Mrs. Tozer, the
first time she had opened her lips, “that's just what I like.
Mr. Northcote has a deal more sense than the like of you. He
knows what's what. Old things like this as might have been
my granny's, they're good enough for every day, they're very
nice for common use; but they ain't no more fit to be put away
in cupboards and hoarded up like fine china, no more than I
am. Mr. Northcote should see our best—that's worth the looking
at; and if I'd known as the gentleman was coming—but you
can't put an old head on young shoulders. Phœbe's as good as
gold, and the trouble she takes with an old woman like me is
wonderful; but she can't be expected to think of everything,
can she now, at her age?”</p>

<p>The two young men laughed—it was the first point of approach
between them, and Phœbe restrained a smile, giving them
a look from one to another. She gave Reginald his cup of tea
very graciously.</p>

<p>“Mr. Northcote prefers the Wedgwood, and Mr. May
doesn't mind, grandmamma,” she said sweetly. “So it is as
well to have the best china in the cupboard. Grandpapa,
another muffin—it is quite hot; and I know that is what you
like best.”</p>

<p>“Well, I'll say that for Phœbe,” said Tozer, with his mouth
full, “that whether she understands china or not I can't tell,
but she knows what a man likes, which is more to the purpose
for a young woman. That's what she does; and looks after
folk's comforts as I never yet saw her match. She's a girl in a
thousand, is Phœbe, junior. There be them as is more for dress,”
he added, fond and greasy, looking at her seated modestly in
that gown, which had filled with awe and admiration the experienced
mind of Mrs. Sam Hurst; “and plays the pianny, and
that sort of style of girl; but for one as minds the comforts of
them about her——” Tozer turned back to the table, and made
a gulp of his last piece of muffin. Eloquence could have no
more striking climax; the proof of all his enthusiasm, was it
not there?</p>

<p>“Don't you play, Miss Beecham?” said Reginald, half-amused,
half-angry.</p>

<p>“A little,” said Phœbe, with a laugh. She had brought down
a small cottage piano out of the drawing-room, where nobody
ever touched it, into a dark corner out of reach of the lamp.
It was the only accomplishment upon which she prided herself.
She got up from the table, when she had poured out another
cup of tea for her grandfather, and without saying a word went
to the little piano. It was not much of an instrument, and
Reginald May was very little of a <i>connoisseur</i>. Northcote,
who knew her gifts, gave himself up to listening, but the Tozers
looked on, shaking their heads, and it was only after some time
had passed, that Reginald began to understand that he was
listening to something which he had never heard before.
Ursula's school-girl tunes had never interested him very much;
he did not know what this was which seemed to creep into his
heart by his ears. He got up by and by, and stole towards the
piano bewildered.</p>

<p>“It'll soon be over, sir,” said Tozer, encouragingly. “Don't
you run away, Mr. May. Them are queer tunes, I allow, but
they don't last long, and your company's an honour. As for
the playing, it'll soon be over; you needn't run away.”</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXVI"/>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h3>THE HALL.</h3>


<p>It is unnecessary to say that the dinner party in the Hall bore
very little resemblance to those simple amusements in No. 6,
Grange Lane. There were three or four people to meet Mr.
May, who, as an orator and literary man, had greater reputation
even such a little way from home than he had in his own town.
He was a very good preacher, and those articles of his were
much admired as “thoughtful” papers, searching into many
mental depths, and fathoming the religious soul with wonderful
insight. Ladies especially admired them; the ladies who were
intellectual, and found pleasure in the feeling of being more
advanced than their neighbours. The Rector's wife of the
parish in which the Dorsets lived applied herself with great
vigour to the art of drawing him out. She asked him questions
with that air of delightful submission to an intellectual
authority which some ladies love to assume, and which it pleases
many men to accept. His daughters were not at all reverential
of Mr. May, and it soothed him to get marks of devotion and
literary submission out of doors. Even Sophy Dorset had gone
through the phase of admiration for her cousin. This had been
dissipated, it is true, long ago; but yet she did not laugh, as
she usually did, at the believers in him. She listened to Mrs.
Rector plying him with eager questions, asking his advice on
that point and the other, and smiled, but was charitable.
As for Cousin Anne, she was charitable by nature, and
all the world got the advantage of it. Little Ursula was one
of her prime favourites—a motherless girl, who was the eldest,
and who had to work for the family, was of all others the
thing which moved her sympathies most. The little Indian
children had long ere this yielded to the charms of Aunt Anne.
They followed her wherever she went like little spaniels, hanging
on by her dress. She had to go up to the nursery to hear
them say their prayers before she dressed for dinner.</p>

<p>“You see, this is a proof that with children one should never
be discouraged,” she said; “for they did not take to me at
first;” and she turned her mild countenance, beaming with soft
light, upon Ursula. To be hampered by these babies clinging
about her, to have them claiming imperiously her attention and
her time, however she might be engaged; to give up to them
the moments of leisure in which otherwise she might have had
a little quiet and repose, this was what Anne Dorset considered
as her recompense.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish I could be as good to Amy and Robin! But I
feel as if I should like to shake them often,” cried Ursula,
“even though I love them with all my heart. Oh! Cousin
Anne, I don't think there is any one like you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is what she thinks her reward,” said Sophy. “I
should like something better, if it was I. Don't copy her,
Ursula. It is better to have children of your own, and get
other people to nurse them. Anne, you see, likes it. I want
you to marry, and get all the good things in this life. Let us
leave the self-denials to her; she likes them, you perceive.”</p>

<p>“I don't know why you should always talk of marrying to
me, Cousin Sophy,” said Ursula with gentle reproach. “I hope
I am not a girl to think of such things.”</p>

<p>“And why not? Is it not the first duty of woman, you
little simpleton?” said Sophy Dorset, with a laugh.</p>

<p>But Ursula could not imagine that it was only in this general
way that her cousin spoke. She could not but feel that this
big Clarence Copperhead, with the diamond buttons, and that
huge expanse of shirt-front, had something to do with Sophy's
talk. There was six feet of him, which is a thing that goes a
long way with a girl; and he was not bad-looking. And why
did he come to Carlingford, having nothing in the world to do
with the place? and coming to Carlingford, why was papa
sought out, of all people, to be his tutor? Certainly the circumstances
were such as invited conjecture, especially when
added on to Sophy's allusions. He took Ursula in to dinner,
which fluttered her somewhat; and though he was much intent
upon the dinner itself, and studied the <i>menu</i> with a devotion
which would have made her tremble for her housekeeping, had
she been sufficiently disengaged to notice it, he yet found time to
talk a little between the courses.</p>

<p>“I did not expect, when I saw you in London, that we were
to meet again so soon, Miss May,” was the perfectly innocent
remark with which he opened the conversation.</p>

<p>Ursula would have said it herself had he not said it, and all
she could do was to answer, “No, indeed,” with a smile.</p>

<p>“And I am coming to your father to be coached,” continued
the young man. “It is a funny coincidence, don't you think
so? I am glad you came to that ball, Miss May. It makes
me feel that I know you. I don't like starting off afresh, all
at once, among people I don't know.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ursula; “I should not like it either. But there
are other people you know in Carlingford. There is the lady
who was at the ball—the young lady in black, I used to call
her—Miss Beecham; you must know her better than you know
me.”</p>

<p>“Who? Phœbe? really!” he said, elevating his eyebrows.
“Phœbe in Carlingford! By Jove! how the governor will
laugh! I should like to know,” with a conscious smile on his
countenance, “what <i>she</i> is doing there.”</p>

<p>“Her grandmamma is ill, and she is nursing her,” said Ursula
simply, at which young Copperhead laughed again.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is how it is! Very good of her, don't you think?
Shouldn't suppose she would be amusing, the old granny, and
Phœbe likes to be amused. I must go to see her as soon as I
can get there. You know, we are Dissenters at home, Miss
May. Good joke, isn't it? The governor will not hear a word
against them. As a matter of fact, nobody does go to chapel
in our rank of life; but the governor sometimes is as obstinate
as an old pig.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he likes it best,” said Ursula, gently; and here a
new course came round, and for the moment Clarence had something
else to do. He resumed after the <i>entrées</i>, which were
poor, as he made a mental note.</p>

<p>“Is there anything to do at Carlingford, Miss May? I
hope you skate. I am not much in the hunting way; nor
your father, I suppose? for, to be sure, a hunting parson would
never do. I am too heavy a weight for most horses, and the
good of galloping over the country all day, after a poor brute
of a fox!—but we must not say that before Sir Robert. I
suppose it is dull?” he said, somewhat pathetically, looking in
her face.</p>

<p>“We don't think it dull, Mr. Copperhead. It may be, perhaps,
for a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“That's it,” said Clarence. “I don't know if it's because
women have more resources, or because they want less; but
you always get on better than we do, somehow; very lucky
for you. You don't expect so much. I believe that's what it
is.”</p>

<p>“Then that shows we are the most sensible,” said Ursula,
roused, and a little indignant.</p>

<p>He paused, to make his choice between the inevitable turkey
and the inevitable beef.</p>

<p>“I hope it's braised,” he said, in a devout undertone. “You
don't expect so much, Miss May, that's what it is; you're
always in the house. You don't care for exercise. Bless you,
if I didn't take exercise, I should be fifteen stone before you
could turn round. How much are you? about eight, perhaps;
not much more. That makes a deal of difference: you don't
require to keep yourself down.”</p>

<p>Ursula did not make any answer. She was prepared to look
upon him very favourably, and accept what he said as full of
originality and force; but the tone the conversation had taken
was not entirely to her mind. Phœbe could have managed it; but
Ursula was not Phœbe. She was more disposed to take offence
at the young man's tone than to guide it into better ways.</p>

<p>“I hope your mother is well,” she said at last, falteringly,
after a long pause. Ursula thought her companion would remark
this pause, and think her displeased. She might have
saved herself the trouble, for it was the braised turkey which
kept Clarence quiet, not offence.</p>

<p>“Oh, quite well, I thank you. Not so well as when I am at
home; she don't like parting with me,” he said, “but, of course,
I can't be always at my mother's apron-strings. Women forget
that.”</p>

<p>“She was very kind when I was in London.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that just pleases her; she is never so happy as when
she is buying things for somebody,” he replied, betraying an
acquaintance with the exact manner of the kindness which
somewhat disturbed poor Ursula: “that is exactly her way.
I dare say she'll come and see the Dorsets while I'm here.”</p>

<p>Then there was again a pause, and Clarence turned to speak
to some one at his other side.</p>

<p>“No, I don't hunt much,” he said; “I have come into the
country to be coached. My father's a modern sort of man,
and wants a fellow to be up in history, and that sort of thing.
Bore—yes; and I dare say Carlingford is very dull. Oh, yes,
I will go out with the hounds now and then, if there is not a
frost. I should rather like a frost for my part.”</p>

<p>It was a hunting lady who had started this new conversation,
into which the stranger had drifted away, leaving Ursula
stranded. She was slightly piqued, it must be allowed, and
when Sophy asked her after dinner how she liked her companion,
made a dignified reply.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt he is very nice,” she said; “I don't know
much of gentlemen. He talks of papa as if he were a school-master,
and thinks Carlingford will be dull.”</p>

<p>“So it is, Ursula. I have often heard you say so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, perhaps; but a stranger ought to be civil,” said the
girl, offended; and she went and entrenched herself by the side
of Cousin Anne, where the new pupil could not come near her.
Indeed he did not seem very anxious to do so, as Ursula soon
saw. She blushed very hotly all by herself, under Cousin
Anne's shadow: that she could have been so absurd as ever to
think—But his size, and the weight over which he had
lamented, and his abundant whiskers and large shirt front,
made it quite impossible for Ursula to think of him as a
person to be educated. It must be Miss Beecham, she said to
herself.</p>

<p>No thoughts of this kind crossed Mr. Clarence Copperhead's
mind, as he stretched his big limbs before the drawing-room
fire after dinner, and said “Brava!” when the ladies sang. He
knew “Brava” was the right thing to say. He liked to be at
the Hall, which he had never visited before, and to know that it
was undeniable gentry which surrounded him, and which at
the piano was endeavouring to gain his approbation. He was so
much his father's son that he had a sense of pleasure and triumph
in being thus elevated; and he had a feeling, more or less, of
contempt for the clergyman, “only a parson,” who was to be
his coach. He felt the power and the beauty of money almost
as much as his father did. What was there he could not buy
with it? the services of the most learned pundit in existence,
for what was learning? or the prettiest woman going to be his
wife, if that was what he wanted. It may be supposed then that
he had very little attention indeed to bestow upon a girl like
Ursula, who was only the daughter of his coach—nobody at all
in particular—and that her foolish fancies on the subject might
have been spared. He aired himself on the hearth-rug with
great satisfaction, giving now and then a shake to one of his
long limbs, and a furtive glance to see that all was perfect in
the <i>sit</i> of the garment that clothed it. He had been ploughed
it is true, but that did not interfere much with his mental
satisfaction; for, after all, scholarship was a thing cultivated
chiefly by dons and prigs, and poor men; and no
doubt this other poor man, the parson, would be able to
put all into his head that was necessary, just as much as
would pay, and no more—a process the mere thought of which
made Clarence yawn, yet which he had wound up his noble
mind to submit to.</p>

<p>“Mind you, I don't say I am going to work,” he had said to
his mother; “but if you think he can put it into me, he may
try,” and he repeated much the same sentiment, with a difference,
to Sophy Dorset, who by way of civility, while the Rector's
wife paid court to Mr. May, talked to Clarence a little, from
the corner of the ottoman close to the fire.</p>

<p>“Work! well, I suppose so, after a sort. I don't mean to
make myself ill with midnight oil and that sort of thing,” he
said (he was not at all clear in his mind as to how the midnight
oil was applied), “but if Mr. May can get it into me, I'll
give him leave; for one thing, I suppose there will be nothing
else to do.”</p>

<p>“Not much in Carlingford; there are neither pictures, nor
museums, nor fine buildings, nor anything of the sort; and
very little society; a few tea-parties, and one ball in the season.”</p>

<p>Mr. Clarence Copperhead shrugged his large shoulders.</p>

<p>“I shan't go to the tea-parties, that's certain,” he said; “a
fellow must hunt a little, I suppose, as the place is so destitute.
As for pictures and museums, that don't trouble me. The worst
of going abroad is that you've always got to look at things of
that sort. To have to do it at home would be beyond a joke.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen the box of curious things John sent me with
the children?” said Sophy. “They are on the table at the end
of the room,—yataghans, and I don't know what other names
they have, all sorts of Indian weapons. I should think you
would be interested in them.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Cousin Sophy, I am very well where I am,” he said.
He looked at her in such a way that she might have appropriated
this remark as a compliment, had she pleased; but Sophy
laughed, and it is to be feared did not feel the compliment, for
she turned right round to somebody else, and took no more
notice of Clarence. He was so fully satisfied with himself that
he had not any strong sense of neglect, though he had but little
conversation with the company. He was quite satisfied to
exhibit himself and his shirt-front before the fire.</p>

<p>Next day he accompanied the Mays back to Carlingford.
Mr. May had enjoyed his visit. His mind was free for the
moment; he had staved off the evil day, and he had a little
money in his pocket, the remains of that extra fifty pounds
which he had put on to Tozer's bill. With some of it he had paid
some urgent debts, and he had presented five pounds to Cotsdean
to buy his wife a gown, and he had a little money in his pockets.
So that in every way he was comfortable and more at ease than
usual. The reckoning was four months off, which was like an
eternity to him in his present mood of mind, and of course he
would get the money before that time. There was so much
time, indeed, that to begin to think of the ways and means of
paying it at this early period seemed absurd. He was to have
three hundred pounds for the year of Copperhead's residence
with him, if he stayed so long, and that would do, if nothing
else. Therefore Mr. May was quite easy in his mind, not in
the least feeling the possibility of trouble in store for him.
And the visit had been pleasant. He had enlarged his acquaintance,
and that among the very sort of people he cared to know.
He had been very well received by all the Dorsets, and introduced
by Sir Robert as a relation, and he had received some
personal incense about his works and his gifts which was sweet
to him. Therefore he was in very good spirits, and exceedingly
amiable. He conversed with his future pupil urbanely, though
he had not concealed his entire concurrence in Sir Robert's
opinion that he was “a cub.”</p>

<p>“What have you been reading lately?” he asked, when they
had been transferred from the Dorsets' carriage, to the admiration
and by the obsequious cares of all the attendant officials,
into the railway carriage. Mr. May liked the fuss and liked
the idea of that superiority which attended the Dorsets' guests.
He had just been explaining to his companions that Sir Robert
was the Lord of the Manor, and that all the homage done to
him was perfectly natural; and he was in great good-humour
even with this cub.</p>

<p>“Well, I've not been reading very much,” said Clarence,
candidly. “What was the good? The governor did not want
me to be a parson, or a lawyer, or anything of that sort, and a
fellow wants some sort of a motive to read. I've loafed a good
deal, I'm afraid. I got into a very good set, you know, first
chop—Lord Southdown, and the Beauchamps, and that lot; and—well,
I suppose we were idle, and that's the truth.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Mr. May; “a good deal of smoke and billiards,
and so forth, and very little work.”</p>

<p>“That's about it,” said the young man, settling himself and his
trousers, which were the objects of a great deal of affectionate
care on his part. He gave them furtive pulls at the knees, and
stroked them down towards the ankle, as he got himself comfortably
into his seat.</p>

<p>Mr. May looked at him with scientific observation, and
Ursula with half-affronted curiosity; his self-occupation was
an offence to the girl, but it was only amusing to her father.
“An unmitigated cub,” Mr. May pronounced to himself; but
there where he sat he represented three hundred a-year, and
that, at least, was not to be despised. Ursula was not so
charitable as her father; she was not amused by him in the
slightest degree. Had he come down to Carlingford in humble
worship of her pretty eyes, and with a romantic intention of
making himself agreeable to her, the captivating flattery would
have prepossessed Ursula, and prepared her to see him in a very
pleasant light, and put the best interpretation upon all he did
and said. But this pretty delusion being dissipated, Ursula
was angry with herself for having been so foolish, and naturally
angry with Clarence for having led her into it, though he was
quite without blame in the matter. She looked at him in his
corner—he had taken the best corner, without consulting her
inclinations—and thought him a vulgar coxcomb, which perhaps
he was. But she would not have been so indignant except for
that little bit of injured feeling, for which really, after all, he
was not justly to blame.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXVII"/>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h3>A PAIR OF NATURAL ENEMIES.</h3>


<p>After the evening at Grange Lane which has been described,
Reginald May met Northcote in the street several times, as was
unavoidable, considering the size of the place, and the concentration
of all business in Carlingford within the restricted
length of the High Street. The two young men bowed stiffly
to each other at first; then by dint of seeing each other frequently,
got to inclinations a little more friendly, until at length
one day when Northcote was passing by the College, as Reginald
stood in the old doorway, the young chaplain feeling magnanimous
on his own ground, and somewhat amused by the idea
which suddenly presented itself to him, asked his Dissenting
assailant if he would not come in and see the place. Reginald
had the best of it in every way. It was he who was the
superior, holding out a hand of favour and kindness to one who
here at least, was beneath him in social consideration; and it
was he who was the assailed, and, so to speak, injured party, and
who nevertheless extended to his assailant a polite recognition,
which, perhaps, no one else occupying the same position would
have given. He was amused by his own magnanimity, and
enjoyed it, and the pleasure of heaping coals of fire upon his
adversary's head was entirely delightful to him.</p>

<p>“I know you do not approve of the place or me,” he said,
forgetting in that moment of triumph all his own objections
to it, and the ground upon which these objections were founded.
“Come in and see it, will you? The chapel and the rooms are
worth seeing. They are fair memorials of the past, however
little the foundation may be to your mind.”</p>

<p>He laughed as he spoke, but without ill-humour; for it is
easy to be good-humoured when one feels one's self on the
gaining, not the losing side. As for Northcote, pride kept him
from any demonstration of unwillingness to look at what the
other had to show. He would not for worlds have betrayed
himself. It was expedient for him, if he did not mean to acknowledge
himself worsted, to put on a good face and accept
the politeness cheerfully. So that it was on the very strength
of the conflict which made them first aware of each other's existence,
that they thus came together. The Dissenter declared
his entire delight in being taken to see the place, and with
secret satisfaction, not easily put into words, the Churchman led
the way. They went to all the rooms where the old men sat,
some dozing by the fire, some reading, some busy about small
businesses; one had a turning-lathe, another was illuminating
texts, a third had a collection of curiosities of a heterogeneous
kind, which he was cleaning and arranging, writing neat little
labels in the neatest little hand for each article.</p>

<p>“The charity of our ancestors might have been worse employed,”
said Reginald. “A home for the old and poor is
surely as fine a kind of benevolence as one could think of—if
benevolence is to be tolerated at all.”</p>

<p>“Ye-es,” said Northcote. “I don't pretend to disapprove of
benevolence. Perhaps the young who have a future before
them, who can be of use to their country, are better objects
still.”</p>

<p>“Because they will pay,” said Reginald; “because we can
get something out of them in return; while we have already
got all that is to be had out of the old people? A very
modern doctrine, but not so lovely as the old-fashioned way.”</p>

<p>“I did not mean that,” said the other, colouring. “Certainly
it ought to pay; everything, I suppose, is meant to pay one
way or other. The life and progress of the young, or the gratified
sentiment of the benefactor, who feels that he has provided
for the old—which is the noblest kind of payment? I think
the first, for my part.”</p>

<p>“For that matter, there is a large and most flourishing school,
which you will come across without fail if you work among the
poor. Do you work among the poor? Pardon my curiosity;
I don't know.”</p>

<p>“It depends upon what you call the poor,” said the other,
who did not like to acknowledge the absence of this element in
Salem Chapel; “if you mean the destitute classes, the lowest
level, no; but if you mean the respectable, comfortable—”</p>

<p>“Persons of small income?” said Reginald. “I mean people
with no incomes at all; people without trades, or anything to
earn a comfortable living by; labouring people, here to-day and
away to-morrow; women who take in washing, and men who go
about hunting for a day's work. These are the kind of people
the Church is weighted with.”</p>

<p>“I don't see any trace of them,” said the Nonconformist.
“Smooth lawns, fine trees, rooms that countesses might live in.
I can't see any trace of them here.”</p>

<p>“There is no harm in a bit of grass and a few trees, and the
rooms are cheaper in their long continuance than any flimsy
new rubbish that could be built.”</p>

<p>“I know I am making an unfortunate quotation,” said
Northcote; “but there is reason in it. It might be sold for so
much, and given to the poor.”</p>

<p>“Cheating the poor, in the first place,” said Reginald, warmly
concerned for what he felt to be his own; “just as the paddock
an old horse dies in might bear a crop instead, and pay the
owner; but what would become of the old horse?”</p>

<p>“Half-quarter of this space would do quite as well for your
pensioners, and they might do without—”</p>

<p>“A chaplain!” said Reginald, laughing in spite of himself.
“I know you think so. It is a sinecure.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think they may say their prayers for themselves; a
young man like you, full of talent, full of capability—I beg
your pardon,” said Northcote, “you must excuse me, I grudge
the waste. There are so many things more worthy of you that
you might do.”</p>

<p>“What, for example?”</p>

<p>“Anything almost,” cried the other; “digging, ploughing,
building—anything! And for me too.”</p>

<p>This he said in an undertone; but Reginald heard, and did
not carry his magnanimity so far as not to reply.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said; “if I am wasted reading prayers for my old
men, what are you, who come to agitate for my abolition? <i>I</i>
think, too, almost anything would be better than to encourage
the ignorant to make themselves judges of public institutions,
which the wisest even find too delicate to meddle with. The
digging and the ploughing might be a good thing for more than
me.”</p>

<p>“I don't say otherwise,” said the young Dissenter, following
into the old fifteenth-century chapel, small but perfect, the
young priest of the place. They stood together for a moment
under the vaulted roof, both young, in the glory of their days,
both with vague noble meanings in them, which they knew so
poorly how to carry out. They meant everything that was fine
and great, these two young men, standing upon the threshold of
their life, knowing little more than that they were fiercely opposed
to each other, and meant to reform the world each in his
own way; one by careful services and visitings of the poor, the
other by the Liberation Society and overthrow of the State
Church; both foolish, wrong and right, to the utmost bounds
of human possibility. How different they felt themselves standing
there, and yet how much at one they were without knowing
it! Northcote had sufficient knowledge to admire the perfect
old building. He followed his guide with a certain humility
through the details, which Reginald had already learned by
heart.</p>

<p>“There is nothing so perfect, so beautiful, so real now-a-days,”
said the young Churchman, with a natural expansion of mind
over the beauty to which he had fallen heir. It seemed to him,
as he looked up at the tall windows with their graceful tracery,
that he was the representative of all who had worked out their
belief in God within these beautiful walls, and of all the perpetual
worshippers who had knelt among the old brasses of the
early founders upon the worn floor. The other stood beside
him with a half envy in his mind. The Dissenter did not feel
himself the heir of those centuries in the same unhesitating
way. He tried to feel that he was the heir of something better
and more spiritual, yet felt a not ungenerous grudge that he
could not share the other kinship too.</p>

<p>“It is very beautiful and noble,” he said. “I should like to
feel for it as you do; but what I should like still better would
be to have the same clear certainty of faith, the same conviction
that what they were doing was the only right thing to do which
made both building and prayer so unfaltering in those days.
We can't be so sure even of the span of an arch now.”</p>

<p>“No—nor can you be content with the old span, even though
it is clearly the best by all rules,” said Reginald. The other
smiled; he was the most speculative of the two, being perhaps
the most thoughtful; and he had no fifteenth-century chapel
to charm, nor old foundation to give him an anchor. He smiled,
but there was a little envy in his mind. Even to have one's
life set out before one within clear lines like this, would not
that be something? If it had but been possible, no doubt
saying prayers for the world, even with no better than the old
men of the College to say amen, had something more beautiful
in it than tours of agitation for the Liberation Society; but
Northcote knew that for him it was not possible, any more than
was the tonsure of Reginald's predecessor, who had said mass
when first those pinnacles were reared towards heaven. After
he had smiled he sighed, for the old faith was more lovely than
all the new agitations; he felt a little ashamed of the Liberation
Society, so long as he stood under that groined and glorious
roof.</p>

<p>“May!” said some one, coming in suddenly. “I want you
to go to the hospital for me. I am obliged to go off to town
on urgent business—convocation work; and I must get a
lawyer's opinion about the reredos question; there is not a
moment to lose. Go and see the people in the pulmonary ward,
there's a good fellow; and there are two or three bad accidents;
and that old woman who is ill in Brown's cottage, you saw her
the other day; and the Simmonds in Back Grove Street. I
should have had a day's work well cut out, if I had not had
this summons to town; but the reredos question is of the first
importance, you know.”</p>

<p>“I'll go,” said Reginald. There is nothing more effectual
in showing us the weakness of any habitual fallacy or assumption
than to hear it sympathetically, through the ears, as it were, of
a sceptic. Reginald, seeing Northcote's keen eyes gleam at
the sound of the Rector's voice, instinctively fell into sympathy
with him, and heard the speech through him; and though he
himself felt the importance of the reredos, yet he saw in a
moment how such a question would take shape in the opinion
of the young Dissenter, in whom he clearly saw certain resemblances
to himself. Therefore he assented very briefly,
taking out his note-book to put down the special cases of which
the Rector told him. They had a confidential conversation in
a corner, during which the new-comer contemplated the figure
of Northcote in his strange semi-clerical garments with some
amaze. “Who is your friend?” he said abruptly, for he was
a rapid man, losing no time about anything.</p>

<p>“It is not my friend at all; it is my enemy who denounced
me at the Dissenters' meeting.”</p>

<p>“Pah!” cried the Rector, curling up his nostrils, as if some
disagreeable smell had reached him. “A Dissenter here! I
should not have expected it from you, May.”</p>

<p>“Nor I either,” said Reginald; but his colour rose. He was
not disposed to be rebuked by any rector in Carlingford or the
world.</p>

<p>“Are you his curate,” said Northcote, “that he orders you
about as if you were bound to do his bidding? I hope, for your
own sake, it is not so.”</p>

<p>Now it was Reginald's turn to smile. He was young, and
liked a bit of grandiloquence as well as another.</p>

<p>“Since I have been here,” he said, “in this sinecure, as you
call it—and such it almost is—I have been everybody's curate.
If the others have too much work, and I too little, my duty is
clear, don't you think?”</p>

<p>Northcote made no reply. Had he known what was about
to be said to him, he might have stirred up his faculties to say
something; but he had not an idea that Reginald would answer
him like this, and it took him aback. He was too honest
himself not to be worsted by such a speech. He bowed his
head with genuine respect. The apology of the Churchman
whom he had assaulted, filled him with a kind of reverential
confusion; he could make no reply in words. And need it be
said that Reginald's heart too melted altogether when he saw
how he had confounded his adversary? That silent assent
more than made up for the noisy onslaught. That he should
have thus overcome Northcote made Northcote appear his
friend. He was pleased and satisfied beyond the reach of
words.</p>

<p>“Will you come to the hospital with me?” he said; and they
walked out together, the young Dissenter saying very little,
doing what he could to arrange those new lights which had
suddenly flashed upon his favourite subject, and feeling that he
had lost his landmarks, and was confused in his path. When
the logic is taken out of all that a man is doing, what is to become
of him? This was what he felt; an ideal person in Reginald's
place could not have made a better answer. Suddenly
somehow, by a strange law of association, there came into his
mind the innocent talk he had overheard between the two girls
who were, he was aware, May's sisters. A certain romantic
curiosity about the family came into his mind. Certainly they
could not be an ordinary family like others. There must be
something in their constitution to account for this sudden downfall,
which he had encountered in the midst of all his theories.
The Mays must be people of a different strain from others; a
peculiar race, to whom great thoughts were familiar; he could
not believe that there was anything common or ordinary in
their blood. He went out in silence, with the holder of the
sinecure which he had so denounced, but which now seemed to
him to be held after a divine fashion, in a way which common
men had no idea of. Very little could he say, and that of the
most commonplace kind. He walked quite respectfully by the
young clergyman's side along the crowded High Street, though
without any intention of going to the hospital, or of actually
witnessing the kind of work undertaken by his new friend.
Northcote himself had no turn that way. To go and minister
at a sick-bed had never been his custom; he did not understand
how to do it; and though he had a kind of sense that it was the
right thing to do, and that if any one demanded such a service
of him he would be obliged to render it, he was all in the
dark as to how he could get through so painful an office;
whereas May went to it without fear, thinking of it only as the
most natural thing in the world. Perhaps, it is possible,
Northcote's ministrations, had he been fully roused, would have
been, in mere consequence of the reluctance of his mind, to
undertake them, more real and impressive than those which
Reginald went to discharge as a daily though serious duty;
but in any case it was the Churchman whose mode was the
more practical, the more useful. They had not gone far together,
when they met the Rector hurrying to the railway; he
cast a frowning, dissatisfied look at Northcote, and caught
Reginald by the arm, drawing him aside.</p>

<p>“Don't be seen walking about with that fellow,” he said;
“it will injure you in people's minds. What have you to do
with a Dissenter—a demagogue? Your father would not like
it any more than I do. Get rid of him, May.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to displease either you or my father,” said
Reginald stiffly; “but, pardon me, in this respect I must judge
for myself.”</p>

<p>“Don't be pig-headed,” said the spiritual ruler of Carlingford;
but he had to rush off for his train, and had no time to
say more. He left Reginald hot and angry, doubly disposed,
as was natural, to march Northcote over all the town, and show
his intimacy with him. Get rid of an acquaintance whom he
chose to extend his countenance to, to please the Rector! For
a man so young as Reginald May, and so lately made independent,
such an act of subserviency was impossible indeed.</p>

<p>Before they entered the hospital, however, another encounter
happened of a very different character. Strolling along in the
centre of the pavement, endeavouring after the almost impossible
combination of a yawn and a cigar, they perceived a large
figure in a very long great-coat, and with an aspect of languor
and <i>ennui</i> which was unmistakable a hundred yards off. This
apparition called a sudden exclamation from Northcote.</p>

<p>“If it was possible,” he said, “I should imagine I knew that
man. Are there two like him? but I can't fancy what he can
be doing here.”</p>

<p>“<i>That</i> fellow!” said Reginald. “It's a pity if there are two
like him. I can't tell you what a nuisance he is to me. His
name is Copperhead; he's my father's pupil.”</p>

<p>“Then it <i>is</i> Copperhead! I thought there could not be
another. He gives a sort of odd familiar aspect to the place all
at once.”</p>

<p>“Then you are a friend of his!” said Reginald, with a groan.
“Pardon the natural feelings of a man whose father has suddenly
chosen to become a coach. I hate it, and my dislike to
the thing is reflected on the person of the pupil. I suppose
that's what my antipathy means.”</p>

<p>“He does not merit antipathy. He is a bore, but there is
no harm in him. Ah! he is quickening his pace; I am afraid
he has seen us; and anybody he knows will be a godsend to
him, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“I am off,” said Reginald; “you will come again? that is,”
he added, with winning politeness, “I shall come and seek
you out. We are each the moral Antipodes of the other, Miss
Beecham says—from which she argues that we should be acquainted
and learn the meaning of our differences.”</p>

<p>“I am much obliged to Miss Beecham.”</p>

<p>“Why, Northcote!” said Clarence Copperhead, bearing
down upon them in his big grey Ulster, like a ship in full sail.
“Morning, May; who'd have thought to see you here. Oh,
don't turn on my account! I'm only taking a walk; it don't
matter which way I go.”</p>

<p>“I am very much hurried. I was just about to hasten off to
an appointment. Good-bye, Northcote,” said Reginald. “We
shall meet again soon, I hope.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! this is a surprise,” said Clarence; “to see you
here, where I should as soon have thought of looking for St.
Paul's; and to find you walking about cheek by jowl with that
muff, young May, who couldn't be civil, I think, if he were to try.
What is the meaning of it? I suppose you're just as much
startled to see me. I'm with a coach; clever, and a good scholar
and a good family, and all that; father to that young sprig: so
there ain't any mystery about me. What's brought you here?”</p>

<p>“Work,” said Northcote, curtly. He did not feel disposed
to enter into any kind of explanation.</p>

<p>“Oh, work! Now I do wonder that a fellow like you, with
plenty of money in your pocket, should go in for work as you
do. What's the good of it? and in the Dissenting parson line
of all things in the world! When a fellow has nothing, you
can understand it; he must get his grub somehow. That's
what people think of you, of course. Me, I don't do anything,
and everybody knows I'm a catch, and all that sort of thing.
Now I don't say (for I don't know) if your governor has as
much to leave behind him as mine—But halt a bit! You walk
as if we were going in for athletics, and doing a two mile.”</p>

<p>“I'm sorry to see you so easily blown,” said Northcote, not
displeased in his turn to say something unpleasant. “What is
it? or are you only out of training?”</p>

<p>“That's it,” said Clarence, with a gasp. “I'm awfully out of
training, and that's the fact. We do, perhaps, live too well in
Portland Place; but look here—about what we were saying—”</p>

<p>“Do you live with the Mays?”</p>

<p>“Worse luck! It's what you call plain cooking; and bless
us all, dinner in the middle of the day, and the children at
table. But I've put a stop to that; and old May ain't a bad
old fellow—don't bother me with work more than I like, and
none of your high mightiness, like that fellow. I'll tell you
what, Northcote, you must come and see me. I haven't got a
sitting-room of my own, which is a shame, but I have the use
of their rooms as much as I like. The sisters go flying away
like a flock of pigeons. I'll tell you what, I'll have you asked
to dinner. Capital fun it will be. A High Church parson
cheek by jowl with a red-hot Dissenter, and compelled to be
civil. By Jove! won't it be a joke?”</p>

<p>“It is not a joke that either of us will enjoy.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, <i>I'll</i> enjoy it, by Jove!” said Copperhead.
“He daren't say no. I'd give sixpence just to see you together,
and the Bashaw of two tails—the young fellow. They shall
have a party; leave it all to me.”</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"/>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<h3>THE NEW PUPIL.</h3>


<p>Mr. May, since the bargain was fairly concluded with the
Copperheads, had thought a great deal about the three hundred
a-year he was to get for his pupil. It almost doubled his
income in a moment, and that has a great effect upon the
imagination. It was true he would have another person to
maintain on this additional income, but still that additional
person would simply fill Reginald's place, and it did not at first
occur to him that what was good enough for himself, Mr. May,
of St. Roque's, was not good enough for any <i>parvenu</i> on the face
of the earth. Therefore the additional income represented a
great deal of additional comfort, and that general expansion of
expenditure, not going into any special extravagances, but
representing a universal ease and enlargement which was congenial
to him, and which was one of the great charms of money
in his eyes. To be sure, when he reflected on the matter, he
felt that the first half-year of Clarence's payment ought to be
appropriated to that bill, which for the present had brought
him so much relief; but this would be so entirely to lose the
benefit of the money so far as he was himself concerned, that
it was only in moments of reflection that this appeared urgent.
The bill to which Tozer's signature had been appended did not
oppress his conscience. After all, what was it? Not a very
large sum, a sum which when put to it, and with time before him,
he could so easily supply; and as for any other consideration,
it was really, when you came to think of it, a quite justifiable
expedient, not to be condemned except by squeamish persons,
and which being never known, could do no harm in the world.
He had not harmed anybody by what he had done. Tozer,
who was quite able to pay it over and over again, would never
know of it; and in what respect, he asked himself, was it worse
to have done this than to have a bill really signed by a man of
straw, whose “value received” meant nothing in the world
but a simple fiction? Cotsdean was no more than a man of
straw; if left to himself, he could not pay anything, nor had
he anything really to do with the business for which his name
stood sponsor; and Tozer's name was merely placed there in
the same fictitious way, without any trouble to Tozer, or burden
of responsibility. What was the difference, except that it saved
trouble and anxiety to everybody except the principal in the
affair—he who ought to bear the brunt? Mr. May recognised
this without doubt. It was he who had reaped the advantage;
and whether Cotsdean was the instrument who knew all about
it, or Tozer, who did not know anything about it, it was he,
Mr. May, whose natural duty it was to meet the claim and pay
the money. He was an honest man; if he was occasionally
a little slow in his payments, no one could throw any doubt
upon his character. But, of course, should any unforeseen
emergency arise, the pupil at once made that straight. Mr.
May felt that he had only to go to the bank, which generally
did not encourage his visits, and tell them of his pupil, to have
the money at once. Nobody could reject such unmistakeable
security. So that really there was no further occasion for so
much as thinking of Tozer; that was provided for; with the
freest conscience in the world he might put it out of his mind.
But how he could feel this so strongly, and at the same time
revel in the consciousness of a fuller purse, more to enjoy, and
more to spend, is a mystery which it would be difficult to solve.
He did so, and many others have done so besides him, eating
their cake, yet believing that they had their cake with the
fullest confidence. He was a sensible man, rather priding
himself on his knowledge of business, with much experience in
human nature, and a thoughtful sense (fully evidenced in his
writings) of all the strange inconsistencies and self-deceits of
mankind; but he dropped into this strain of self-delusion with
the calmest satisfaction of mind, and was as sure of his own
good sense and kindness as if he had never in all his life taken
a step out of the rigidest of the narrow ways of uprightness.</p>

<p>Some part of this illusion, however, was sharply dispelled at
a very early date. Clarence Copperhead, who was not likely
to err by means of too much consideration for the feelings of
others, grumbled frankly at the mid-day meal.</p>

<p>“I don't understand a two o'clock dinner,” he said; “it's
lunch, that's what I call it; and I won't be disagreeable about
the kids, but I must have my dinner. Bless you! a man can't
live without his dinner. What is he to do? It is the sort of
thing you can look forward to, whatever happens. If it's a wet
day, or anything of that sort, there's always dinner; and after
it's over, if there's music or a rubber, why that's all very well;
or if a man feels a bit sleepy, it doesn't matter. Why, dinner's
your stand-by, wherever you are. I'd as soon do without my
head, for my part.”</p>

<p>Ursula hastened to tell her father this with dismay in her
looks.</p>

<p>“I've always heard that late dinners were so expensive; you
require twice as many dishes. At two, one has only what is
necessary; but at seven, you require to have fish, and soup, and
<i>entrées</i>, and all sorts of things, besides the joint. It was disgraceful
of him to say it!” cried Ursula; “and I think he
ought to be made to follow our plan, whatever it is, and not do
everything he likes here.”</p>

<p>“That is all very true,” said Mr. May; “but he is right
about the dinner; it is a great deal more agreeable.”</p>

<p>“And expensive, papa.”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps it is a great deal to expect at your age; but
if you read your cookery-book, as I have often said, when you
were reading those novels, and learned how to toss up little
dishes out of nothing, and make <i>entrées</i>, and so forth, at next
to no expense—”</p>

<p>The tears came into Ursula's eyes at this unjust assault.</p>

<p>“Papa,” she said, “you ought to know better at your age.
One forgives the boys for saying such silly things. How can I
toss up little dishes out of nothing? If you only knew the
price of butter, not to talk of anything else. Made dishes are
the most expensive things! A leg of mutton, for instance;
there it is, and when one weighs it, one knows what it costs;
but there is not one of those <i>entrées</i> but costs <i>shillings</i> for
herbs and truffles and gravy and forcemeat, and a glass of white
wine here, and a half pint of claret there. It is all very well
to talk of dishes made out of nothing. The meat may not be
very much—and men never think of the other things, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“It is management that is wanted,” said Mr. May, “to
throw nothing away, to make use of everything, to employ all
your scraps. If you once have a good sauce—which is as easy
as daylight when you take the trouble—you can make all sorts
of things out of a cold joint; but women never will take the
trouble, and that is the secret of poor dinners. Not one in
fifty will do it. If you wanted really to help us, and improve
my position, you might, Ursula. I can't afford to fall out with
Copperhead, he is very important to me just at this moment;
and perhaps it is better that I should give in to him at once
about the late dinner.”</p>

<p>“You may say it is not my business,” said Ursula, “but we
have already another maid, and now two dinners—for it is just
the same as two dinners. He will not be any advantage to you
like that, and why should he be so much harder to please than
we are? Reginald never grumbled, who was much better bred
and better educated than Mr. Copperhead.”</p>

<p>“And with so much money to keep up his dignity,” said her
father mockingly. “No, it is not your business, the cookery-book
is your business, and how to make the best of everything;
otherwise I don't want any advice from you.”</p>

<p>“What did he say?” cried Janey, rushing in as soon as her
father had left the room. Ursula, a very general consequence
of such interviews, was sitting by the fire, very red and excited,
with tears glistening in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Of course I knew what he would say; he says it is not my
business, and there are to be late dinners, and everything that
man chooses to ask for. Oh, it is so hard to put up with
it!” cried Ursula, her eyes flashing through her tears. “I am
to read up the cookery-book and learn to make <i>entrées</i> for
them; but to say we can't afford it is not my business. I
wonder whose business it is? It is I who have to go to the
tradespeople and to bear it all if they grumble; and now this
horrible man, who dares to tell me the coffee is not strong
enough, as if I was a barmaid—”</p>

<p>“Barmaids don't have to do with coffee, have they?” said
matter-of-fact Janey; “but the fact is <i>he is not a gentleman</i>;
why should you mind? What does it matter what a person
like that says or does? You said so yourself, he is not a bit a
gentleman. I wonder what Cousin Anne and Cousin Sophy
could mean.”</p>

<p>“It is not their fault; they think of his mother, who is nice,
who sent those things; but Mr. Copperhead knew about the
things, which was not so nice of her, was it? But never mind,
we must try to make the best of it. Get the cookery-book,
Janey; perhaps if you were to read it out loud, and we were
both to try to fix our mind upon it—for something must be
done,” said Ursula gravely. “Papa will never find it out till
all the money is spent, but we shall be poorer than we were
before we had the pupil. Who is that, Janey, at the door?”</p>

<p>It was Phœbe, who came in blooming from the cold, in a
furred jacket, at which the girls looked with unfeigned admiration.
“The skating will soon come on in earnest now,” she
said; “grandmamma is better, and I thought I might come and
see you. I had a long talk with your brother the other day,
did he tell you? and I made him know Mr. Northcote, one of
our people. I know you will turn up your pretty nose, Ursula,
at a Dissenter.”</p>

<p>“I should think so,” cried Janey; “we have nothing to do
with such people, being gentlefolks, have we, Ursula? Oh, I
forgot! I beg your pardon, I didn't mean to say—”</p>

<p>Phœbe smiled upon her serenely. “I am not angry,” she
said, “I understand all that; and in Carlingford I have no
right, I suppose, to stand upon being a lady, though I always
thought I was one. I am only a young woman here, and not
so bad either for that, if you will promise, Janey, not to call me
a young person—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Beecham!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Copperhead is a Dissenter,” said Ursula, somewhat
sullenly, “we put up with him because he is rich. Oh, it is all
very disagreeable! I don't want to know any new people
whatever they are; I find the old ones bad enough. Reginald
hates him too, a big lazy useless being that treats one as if one
were a chambermaid!”</p>

<p>“Is it Clarence? It is not quite his fault. His mother is
a lady, but his father is a brute,” said Phœbe, “thinking of
nothing but his horrible money. Clarence is not so bad. It is
because he has no imagination, and does not understand other
people's feelings; he does not mean it, poor fellow; he goes
trampling about with his big feet upon everybody's toes, and
never is a bit the wiser. Here he is—he is coming in with your
father. I suppose there must be a great deal in race,” she
added with a soft little sigh, “Clarence looks a clown, and your
father such a gentleman. I suppose I show just the same when
I stand beside you.”</p>

<p>Now Phœbe was well aware that this was not the case, and
Ursula's indignant disclaimer made her rather laugh, because it
was so unnecessary, than be pleased by its vehemence. There
was an old convex mirror opposite which reflected the girls in
miniature, making a pretty picture of them as they sat together,
Ursula with her dark locks, and Phœbe in her golden hair, and
the tall sharp school-girl, Janey, all elbows and angles, short
petticoats and grey stockings. Janey was the only one in
whom there could have been suspected any inferiority of race;
but her awkwardness was that of youth, and her disordered hair
and dress belonged also to her age, for she was at that troublesome
period when frocks are constantly getting too short, and
sleeves too scanty. Janey was shuffling slowly round the
visitor, admiring her at every point; her garments were not
made as dresses were made in Carlingford. Their fit and their
texture were alike too perfect for anything that ever came out
of High Street. The furred jacket had not been seen in Grange
Lane before. Perhaps it was because the cold had become
more severe, an ordinary and simple reason—or because
Clarence Copperhead, who knew her, and in whose eyes it was
important to bate no jot of her social pretensions, was here;
and the furred jacket was beyond comparison with anything
that had been seen for ages in Carlingford. The deep border
of fur round the velvet, the warm waddings and paddings, the
close fit up to the throat, were excellencies which warranted
Janey's tour of inspection. Phœbe perceived it very well, but
did not confuse the girl by taking any notice, and in her heart
she was herself slightly pre-occupied, wondering (as Ursula had
done) what the man had come here for, and what he would say
when he saw her. Both of these young women had a secret
belief that something romantic, something more than the mere
prose of reading in the first tutor's house that happened to have
been suggested to him, had brought young Copperhead to such
an unlikely place as Carlingford. Ursula had by this time
learned to reject this hypothesis with much indignation at
herself for having entertained it, but Phœbe still felt slightly
fluttered by this possibility, and was eager for the entrance of
Clarence. She would know at once what had brought him, she
said to herself, the moment she caught his eye.</p>

<p>And though Mr. May had reconciled himself so completely
to the Tozer business, the appearance of Tozer's granddaughter
gave him a momentary shock. “What did you do with my
grandfather's letter? he thought her eyes said, and the meeting
confused and disturbed him. This, however, was only for a moment.
He was a man to whom it was always possible to make
himself agreeable to women, and though he felt so easy in his
mind about Tozer, still it was evident that to conciliate Tozer's
relation, and that so influential a relation, was on the whole a
good thing to do. He was going up to her accordingly with
outstretched hands, and the most amiable inquiries about her
grandmother's health, when, to his surprise, he was frustrated
by Clarence who had come in before him—his large person
swelling out, as it always seemed to do when he presented
himself upon a new scene, with importance and grandeur.</p>

<p>“Miss Beecham!” he said, “really, who would have thought
it? Now look here, I came to Carlingford thinking there was
not a soul I knew in the place; and here have you turned up
all at once, and Northcote (you know Northcote?). It is very
queer.”</p>

<p>“It is odd, isn't it?” said Phœbe quickly. “I was astonished
to see Mr. Northcote, and though I heard you were coming I
am not less surprised to see you.” “He has not come for me,”
she said rapidly to herself, “nor for Ursula either; then who
is it?” Phœbe demanded in the depths of her own bosom; that
he should have come for nobody at all, but simply for his own
purposes, to get a little information put into his head, seemed
incredible to both the girls. Ursula, for her part, had been
angry when she discovered his want of meaning, though why
she would have found it hard to say. But Phœbe, for her part,
was not angry. She took this like other things of the kind,
with great and most philosophical calm, but she could not outgrow
it all at once. For whom was it? His cousins, those
Miss Dorsets? But they were much older, and not the kind
of women for whom such an act was likely. Her mind wandered
forth lively and curious in search of the necessary clue.
She could not consent to the fact that no clue was necessary
where no mystery was.</p>

<p>“I am glad to see that you venture out in this wintry weather,”
said Mr. May; “you set us all a good example. I am always
telling my girls that cold weather is no sufficient reason for
staying indoors. I wish Ursula would do as you do.”</p>

<p>“Papa, how can you talk so?” said Janey, indignant, “when
you know very well it is not the cold that keeps Ursula in, but
because she has so much to do.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, one knows the sort of things young ladies have to
do,” said Clarence, with a laugh; “read stories, and look up
pretty dresses for their parties, eh, Miss Janey? and consult
the fashion-books. Oh, of course you will deny it; but my
mother makes me her confidant, and I know that's what you
all do.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said Phœbe, “we are not so clever as you are,
and can't do so many things. We know no Latin or Greek to
keep our minds instructed; we acknowledge our infirmity; and
we couldn't play football to save our lives. Football is what
you do in this season, when you don't hunt, and before the ice
is bearing? We are poor creatures; we can't parcel out our
lives, according as it is time for football or cricket. You must
not be so severe upon girls for being so inferior to you.”</p>

<p>(“Oh, don't be too hard upon him,”) whispered Ursula, in
a parenthesis, afraid that this irony should drive the pupil to
desperation. (“Hard upon him! he will never find it out,”)
Phœbe whispered back in the same tone.</p>

<p>“Oh, hang it all, I don't mean to be severe upon girls,” said
Clarence, pulling his moustache with much complacency; “I
am sorry for them, I can tell you. It ain't their fault; I know
heaps of nice girls who feel it horribly. What can they do?
they can't go in for cricket and football. There ought to be
something invented for them. To be sure there is lawn-tennis,
but that's only for summer. I should go mad, I think, if I
had nothing to do.”</p>

<p>“But you have more brain and more strength, you see, than
we have; and besides, we are used to it,” said Phœbe. “I am
afraid, Ursula, grandmamma will want me, and I must go.”</p>

<p>Here Mr. May said something to his daughter which filled
Ursula with excitement, mingled of pleasure and displeasure.</p>

<p>“Papa says, will you come to dinner to-morrow at seven?
It appears there is some one you know coming—a Mr. Northcote.
I don't know who he is, but it will be very kind if you
will come on my account,” the girl concluded, whispering in
her ear, “for how shall I ever get through a dinner-party?
We never gave one in my life before.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will come,” said Phœbe. “Dinner-parties are
not so common here that I should neglect the chance. I
must thank Mr. May. But I hope you know who Mr. Northcote
is,” she added, laughing. “I gave an account of myself
loyally, before I permitted you to ask me; but Mr. Northcote—Oh,
no! he does not belong to——the lower classes; but he
is a fiery red-hot——”</p>

<p>“What?” cried eager Janey, pressing to the front. “Radical?
I am a radical too; and Reginald used to be once, and so
was Ursula. Oh, I wish it was to-night!” said Janey, clasping
her hands.</p>

<p>“Not a radical, but a Dissenter; and you who are a clergyman,
Mr. May! I like you, oh, so much for it. But I wonder
what the people will say.”</p>

<p>“My dear Miss Beecham,” said the suave Churchman, quite
ready to seize the chance of making a point for himself, “in
the Church, fortunately, what the people say has not to be
studied, as your unfortunate pastors, I am informed, have to do.
While Mr. Copperhead is under my roof, I make his friends
welcome—for his sake first, probably afterwards for their own.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I asked Northcote,” said Clarence; “I never thought
they would have any objection. He's not a common Dissenter,
like the most of those fellows that have nothing but their
salaries. He's well off; he don't require, bless you, to keep
people in good temper, and toady to 'em, like most do. He's
as independent as I am; I don't say that he's quite as well off;
but money always finds its level. I shouldn't have thought of
asking May to receive a common Dissenting fellow, like the
rest.”</p>

<p>Phœbe laughed. It did not occur to the accomplished scion
of the house of Copperhead, nor to the two girls, who were not
experienced enough to think of such things, what was the
meaning expressed in Phœbe's laugh, which was not cheerful.
Mr. May himself had the advantage of more discrimination.</p>

<p>“I hope you will find that, Dissenter or not, I know what is
my duty to my friends,” he said. “What my guests may
possess, or the exact nature of their opinions on all points, are
not subjects to be discussed by me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, there is nothing to find fault with in <i>you</i>,” said Phœbe,
with less than her usual universal courtesy; “you are always
kind, Mr. May;” and then she laughed again. “Some people
are very clever in finding out the vulnerable places,” she said.</p>

<p>“She is changed,” said Clarence, when she was gone. “She
is not the jolly girl she used to be. She was always a very
jolly girl; ready to help a fellow out of a scrape, you know.
But Northcote's a fearfully clever fellow. You should just
hear him talk. He and May will go at it hammer and tongs,
as sure as fate.”</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXIX"/>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<h3>URSULA'S ENTRÉES.</h3>


<p>It would be difficult to describe the anxiety with which that
first “late dinner” was regarded by Ursula. Janey, too, had
thrown herself into it heart and soul, until she received the
crushing intimation from her father, that her company was not
expected at this stately meal; a discovery which altogether
extinguished poor Janey, accustomed to be always in the front
whatever occurred, and to whom suggestions of things that
could not be done by a girl who was not “out,” had never
presented themselves. She retired to her own room dissolved
in tears when this fearful mandate went forth, and for the rest
of the morning was good for nothing, her eyes being converted
into a sort of red pulp, her rough hair doubly dishevelled, her
whole being run into tears. She was of no more use now to go
errands between the kitchen and the drawing-room, or to read
the cookery-book out loud, which was a process upon which
Ursula depended very much, to fix in her mind the exact
ingredients and painful method of preparation of the <i>entrées</i>
at which she was toiling. Betsy, the former maid-of-all-work,
now promoted under the title of cook, could be trusted to
roast the saddle of mutton, which, on consideration that it was
“a party,” had been thought preferable to a leg, and she could
boil the fish, after a sort, and make good honest family soup,
and the rice-pudding or apple-tart, which was the nearest
approach to luxury indulged in at the Parsonage; but as for
<i>entrées</i>, Betsy did not know what they were. She had heard
of made dishes indeed, and respectfully afar off had seen them
when she was kitchen-maid at Lady Weston's—the golden age
of her youthful inexperience. But this was so long ago, that
her recollections were rather confusing than useful to Ursula,
when she went downstairs to make her first heroic effort.</p>

<p>“La, Miss, that ain't how cook used to do 'em at Lady
Weston's,” Betsy said, looking on with unbelieving eyes. She
was sure of this negative, but she was not sure of anything else,
and utterly failed to give any active assistance, after driving
the girl desperate with her criticisms. Altogether it was a
confused and unpleasant day. When Reginald came in in the
morning, his sister had no time to speak to him, so anxious was
she and pre-occupied, and the drawing-room was being turned
upside down, to make it look more modern, more elegant, more
like the Dorsets' drawing-room, which was the only one
Ursula knew. The comfortable round table in the middle,
round which the family had grouped themselves for so long, had
been pushed aside into a corner, leaving one fresh patch of carpet,
quite inappropriate, and unconnected with anything else;
and instead of the work and the school-books which so often
intruded there, all that was gaudy and uninteresting in the May
library had been produced to decorate the table; and even a
case of wax flowers, a production of thirty years since, which
had been respectfully transferred to a china closet by Ursula's
better taste, but which in the dearth of ornament she had
brought back again. Reginald carried off the wax flowers and
replaced the table with his own hands, while Ursula scorched
her cheeks over the <i>entrées</i> downstairs.</p>

<p>“All this for Northcote,” he said, when she ran up for a
moment, done up in a big white apron, her face crimson with
the fire and anxiety combined: “for Miss Beecham has been
here before, and you made no fuss about her then.”</p>

<p>“She came to tea,” said Ursula. “And I got a cake, which
was all any one could do; but a dinner is a very different thing.”
Indeed she had by this time come to share her father's opinion,
that dinner was the right and dignified thing in all cases, and
that they had been hitherto living in a very higgledy-piggledy
way. The dinner had gone to her head.</p>

<p>“Then it is for Northcote, as I say,” said Reginald. “Do
you know who he is?”</p>

<p>“A Dissenter,” said Ursula, with a certain languor; “but
so, you know, is Mr. Copperhead, and he is the chief person
here now-a-days. Papa thinks there is nobody like him. And
so is Phœbe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, have you come so far as that?” said Reginald, with a
little tinge of colour in his face. He laughed, but the name
moved him. “It is a pretty fresh sort of country name, not
quite like such an accomplished person.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that is just like you men, with your injustice! Because
she is clever you take it amiss; you are all jealous of her. Look
at her pretty colour and her beautiful hair; if that is not fresh
I should like to know what is. She might be Hebe instead of
Phœbe,” said Ursula, who had picked up scraps of classical
knowledge in spite of herself.</p>

<p>“You are a little goose,” said Reginald, pinching her ear, but
he liked his sister for her generous partizanship. “Mind you
don't come to dinner with cheeks like that,” he said. “I like my
sister to be herself, not a cook-maid, and I don't believe in
<i>entrées</i>;” but he went away smiling, and with a certain warmth
in his breast. He had gone up and down Grange Lane many
times at the hour of sunset, hoping to meet Phœbe again, but
that sensible young woman had no mind to be talked of, and
never appeared except when she was certain the road was clear.
This had tantalized Reginald more than he chose to avow, even
to himself. Pride prevented him from knocking at the closed
door. The old Tozers were fearful people to encounter, people
whom to visit would be to damn himself in Carlingford;
but then the Miss Griffiths were very insipid by the side of
Phœbe, and the variety of her talk, though he had seen so little
of her, seemed to have created a new want in his life. He
thought of a hundred things which he should like to discuss
with her—things which did not interest Ursula, and which the
people about him did not understand much. Society at that
time, as may be presumed, was in a poor way in Carlingford.
The Wentworths and Wodehouses were gone, and many other
nice people; the houses in Grange Lane were getting deserted,
or falling into inferior hands, as was apparent by the fact that
the Tozers—old Tozer, the butterman—had got one of them.
The other people were mostly relics of a bygone state of
things: retired old couples, old ladies, spinsters, and widows—excellent
people, but not lively to talk to—and the Griffiths,
above mentioned, put up with in consideration of tolerable good
looks and “fun,” became tiresome when anything better was to
be had. The mere apparition of Phœbe upon the horizon had
been enough to show Reginald that there were other kinds of
human beings in the world. It had not occurred to him that
he was in love with her, and the idea of the social suicide implied
in marrying old Tozer's granddaughter, had not so much
as once entered his imagination. Had he thought of it, he
would have pulled that imagination up tight, like an unruly
horse, the thing being too impossible to bear thinking of.
But this had never entered his mind. He wanted to see
Phœbe to talk to her, to be near her, as something very new,
captivating and full of interest—that was all. No one else
within his sphere could talk so well. The Rector was very
great indeed on the reredos question, and the necessity of
reviving the disused “Church” customs; but Reginald could
not go so far as he did as to the importance of the reredos, and
was quite in doubt whether it was not as well for most people to
“direct” themselves by their own consciences as to be directed
by the spiritual head of the parish, who was not over wise in his
own concerns. His father, Reginald knew, could be very agreeable
among strangers, but he seldom chose to be so in his own
house. All this made the advent of Phœbe appear to him like a
sudden revelation out of a different world. He was an Oxford
man, with the best of education, but he was a simpleton all the
same. He thought he saw in her an evidence of what life was
like in those intellectual professional circles which a man may
hope to get into only in London. It was not the world of fashion
he was aware, but he thought in his simplicity that it was the still
higher world of culture and knowledge, in which genius, and
wit, and intellect stood instead of rank or riches. How Tozer's
granddaughter had got admission there, he did not ask himself,
but this was what he thought, and to talk to her was a
new sensation. He was quite unconscious of anything more.</p>

<p>Nobody knew when Ursula took her place at the head of the
table in her pretty white dress, which she had worn at the
Dorsets', how much toil and anxiety the preparations had given
her. At the last moment, when her mind was so far clear of
the <i>entrées</i>, &amp;c.—as clear as the mind of an inexperienced
dinner-giver can be, until the blessed moment when they are
eaten and done with—she had to take Sarah in hand, who was
not very clear about the waiting, and to instruct her according
to her own very imperfect knowledge how to fulfil her duties.</p>

<p>“Think it is not a dinner-party at all, but only just our
ordinary luncheon, and don't get fluttered; and when I look
at you like <i>this</i> come quite close, and I will whisper what you
are to do. And oh, Sarah, like a good creature, don't break
anything!” said Ursula almost with tears.</p>

<p>These were all the directions she could give, and they, it
must be allowed, were somewhat vague. The excitement was
becoming to her. She sat down with a dreadful flutter in her
heart, but with her eyes shining and sparkling. Clarence
Copperhead, who extended an arm very carelessly to take her
downstairs, absolutely certain of being a more important
person than his guest Northcote, was roused for the first time
to the consciousness that she was very pretty, which he had
not found out before. “But no style,” he said to himself.
Phœbe was the one who had style. She sat between Mr. May and
the stranger, but devoted herself to her host chiefly, displaying
a gentle contempt of the younger men in his presence. No
anxiety was in her mind about the dinner. She did not follow
the fate of those <i>entrées</i> round the table with terrible palpitations,
as poor Ursula did; and, alas, the <i>entrées</i> were not
good, and Ursula had the mortification to see the dishes she
had taken so much trouble with, rejected by one and another.
Reginald ate some, for which she blessed him, and so did
Phœbe, but Mr. May sent his plate away with polite execrations.</p>

<p>“Tell your cook she shall go if she sends up such uneatable
stuff again, Ursula,” her father cried from the other
end of the table.</p>

<p>Two big tears dashed up hot and scalding into Ursula's
eyes. Oh, how she wished she could be dismissed like Betsy!
She turned those two little oceans of trouble piteously, without
knowing it, upon Northcote, who had said something to
her, without being able to reply to him. And Northcote, who
was but a young man, though he was a fiery political Dissenter,
and who had come to the Parsonage with a curious
mixture of pleasure and reluctance, immediately threw down
any arms that nature might have provided him with, and
fell in love with her there and then on the spot! to his
own absolute consternation. This was how it happened.
The moment was not romantic, the situation was not sublime.
A little motherless housekeeper crying because her father
scolded her in public for a piece of bad cookery. There is
nothing in this to make an idyll out of; but such as it was, it
proved enough for Horace Northcote; he yielded himself on
the spot. Not a word was said, for Ursula felt that if she
tried to talk she must cry, and anything further from her
troubled thoughts than love it would be impossible to imagine;
but then and there, so far as the young man was concerned,
the story began. He talked very little for the rest of the
meal, and Ursula did not exert herself, though she recovered
slightly when the mutton turned out to be very good, and
was commended; but what was the mutton in comparison
with her <i>entrées</i>, which she had made with her own hands,
and which were a failure? She was reduced to silence, and
she thought that the stranger at her left hand was nice,
because he did not bother her, and was content with a very
little talk.</p>

<p>“Oh, Phœbe, did you hear papa about those <i>entrées</i>?” she
cried, when they reached the drawing-room; and sitting down
on the stool by the fire which Janey usually appropriated, she
cried, poor child, with undisguised passion. “I had made
them myself; I had been busy about them all day; I read the
cookery-book till my head ached, and took such pains! and
you heard what he said.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear, I heard him; but he did not think what he was
saying, it never occurred to him that it was you. Don't
shake your little head, I am sure of it; you know, Ursula,
your papa is very agreeable and very clever.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know he is clever; and he can be nice when he
likes—”</p>

<p>“Did you like it?” cried Janey, bursting in, red-eyed and
dishevelled in her morning frock. “Oh, no, I am not dressed,
I don't mean to, to let him get the better of me, and think I
care. Only just for a moment to see you two. Oh, isn't
Phœbe grand in that dress? She is like a picture; you are
nothing beside her, Ursula. Tell me, is it nice to have dinner
instead of tea? Did it go off very well, did you enjoy yourselves?
Or were you all unhappy, sitting round the table,
eating beef and mutton,” cried Janey with all the scorn of
ignorance, “at that ridiculous hour!”</p>

<p>“I was as miserable as I could be,” cried Ursula, “I was
not happy at all. Enjoy myself! with the <i>entrées</i> on my
mind, and after what papa said. Oh, run away, Janey, and
dress, or else go to bed. Papa will be so angry if he comes up
and finds you here.”</p>

<p>“I should like to make him frantic,” cried Janey with
vindictive force, “I should just like to drive him out of his
senses! Never mind, yes, I am angry; haven't I a right to
be angry? I am as tall as Ursula—I hope I know how to
behave myself—and when there were people coming, and a real
dinner—”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hear them,” cried Ursula in alarm, and Janey flew
off, her hair streaming behind her. Phœbe put her arm
round Ursula, and raised her from the stool. She was not
perhaps a perfect young woman, but had her own ends to serve
like other people; yet she had a friendly soul. She gave her
friend a kiss to preface her admonition, as girls have a way of
doing.</p>

<p>“I would not let Janey talk so,” she said, “I think you
should not talk so yourself, Ursula, if you will forgive me, of
your papa; he is very nice, and so clever. I should try all I
could to please him, and I should not let any one be disrespectful
to him if it was I.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Phœbe, if you only knew—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, gentlemen don't understand often; but we
must do our duty. He is nice, and clever, and handsome, and
you ought to be proud of him. Dry your eyes, here they are
really, coming upstairs. You must be good-humoured and
talk. He is ever so much nicer than the young men,” said
Phœbe, almost loud enough to be heard, as Clarence Copperhead,
sauntering in advance of the others with his large shirt-front
fully displayed, came into the room. He came in half
whistling in serene indifference. Phœbe had “style,” it was
true; but she was only a Dissenting parson's daughter, and
what were two such girls to Clarence Copperhead? He came
in whistling an opera air, which he let drop only after he was
well inside the door.</p>

<p>“Miss Beecham, let us have some music. I know you can
play,” he said.</p>

<p>“If Miss May likes,” said Phœbe, covering his rudeness;
and then she laughed, and added, “if you will accompany me.”</p>

<p>“Does Mr. Copperhead play too?”</p>

<p>“Oh beautifully. Has he not let you see his music?
Won't you bring it here and let us look over it? I dare say
there are some things we can play together.”</p>

<p>“You can play everything,” said the young man. “And
I'll bring my violin, if you like.”</p>

<p>He was delighted; he quickened his steps almost into a run
as he went away.</p>

<p>“You should not laugh at Mr. Copperhead,” Ursula retorted
on her friend. “You should be good-humoured, too. You
are better than I am, but you are not quite good, after all.”</p>

<p>“Violin!” said Mr. May. “Heaven and earth! is there
going to be any fiddling? Miss Beecham, I did not expect
you to bring such a horror upon me. I thought I had nothing
but good to expect from you.”</p>

<p>“Wait till you hear him, sir,” said Phœbe.</p>

<p>Mr. May retired to the far corner of the room. He called
young Northcote to him, who was standing beside Ursula,
eager to talk, but not knowing how to begin. It was bad
enough to be thus withdrawn from his chance of making himself
agreeable; but the reader may imagine what was the
Dissenter's feelings when Mr. May, with a smile, turned upon
him. Having given him a (tolerably) good dinner, and lulled
him into a belief that his sins against the family were unknown,
he looked at him, smiling, and began.</p>

<p>“Mr. Northcote, the first time I saw you, you were discoursing
at an Anti-Establishment Meeting in the Town Hall.”</p>

<p>Northcote started. He blushed fiery red. “It is quite true.
I wished to have told you; not to come here on false pretences;
but Copperhead—and your son has been very kind—”</p>

<p>“Then I suppose your views are modified. Clergymen no
longer appear to you the demons in human shape you thought
them then; and my son, in particular, has lost his horns and
hoofs?”</p>

<p>“Mr. May, you are very severe; but I own there is reason—”</p>

<p>“It was you who were severe. I was not quite sure of you
till Copperhead brought you in. Nay,” said the clergyman,
rubbing his hands; “do you think that I object to the utterance
of a real opinion? Certainly not. As for Reginald, it
was the thing that decided him; I leave you to find out how;
so that we are positively in your debt. But I hope you don't
fiddle too. If you like to come with me to my study—”</p>

<p>Northcote gave a longing look round the room, which had
become all at once so interesting to him. Mr. May was too
clear-sighted not to see it. He thought, quite impartially,
that perhaps it was an excusable weakness, even though it was
his own society that was the counter attraction. They were
two nice-looking girls. This was how he put it, being no longer
young, and father to one of them; naturally, the two young
men would have described the attraction of Phœbe and Ursula
more warmly. Clarence Copperhead, who had come in with
an armful of music and his fiddle, was not thinking of the girls,
nor of anything but the sweet sounds he was about to make—and
himself. When he began to tune his violin, Mr. May got
up in dismay.</p>

<p>“This is more than mortal can stand,” he said, making as
though he would have gone away. Then he changed his mind,
for, after all, he was the chaperon of his motherless girl. “Get
me the paper, Ursula,” he said. It would be hard to tell with
what feelings Northcote contemplated him. He was the father
of Ursula, yet he dared to order her about, to bring the tears
to her eyes. Northcote darted the same way as she was going,
and caught at the paper on a side-table, and brought it hastily.
But alas, that was last week's paper! he did not save her the
trouble, but he brought upon himself a gleam of mischief
from her father's eyes. “Mr. Northcote thinks me a tyrant
to send you for the paper,” he said, as he took it out of her
hands. “Thank him for his consideration. But he was not
always so careful of your peace of mind,” he added, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>Ursula looked at him with a wondering question in her eyes;
but those tears were no longer there which had gone to Northcote's
heart.</p>

<p>“I don't know what papa means,” she said, softly; and then,
“I want to beg your pardon, please. I was very silly. Will
you try to forget it, and not tell any one, Mr. Northcote?
The truth was, I thought I had done them nicely, and I was
vexed. It was very childish,” she said, shaking her head with
something of the same moisture floating back over the lustre in
her pretty eyes.</p>

<p>“I will never tell any one, you may be sure,” said the young
man; but Ursula did not notice that he declined to give the
other pledge, for Reginald came up just then with wrath in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Is that idiot going to fiddle all night?” he cried (poor
Clarence had scarcely begun); “as if anybody wanted to hear
him and his tweedle-dees. Miss Beecham plays like St. Cecilia,
Ursula; and I want to speak to her about something. Can't
you get that brute beguiled away?”</p>

<p>Clarence was the one who was <i>de trop</i> in the little party;
but he fiddled beatifically, with his eyes fixed on the ceiling,
without the slightest suspicion of the fact, while Phœbe accompanied
him, with little smiles at her friends, and shrugs of
her shoulders. Reginald felt very strongly, though for the
first time, that she was over doing the Scriptural maxim of
being all things to all men.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXX"/>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<h3>SOCIETY AT THE PARSONAGE.</h3>


<p>After this dinner-party, such as it was, the Parsonage became
gradually the centre of a little society, such as sometimes
forms in the most accidental way in a house where there are
young men and young women, and of which no one can say
what momentous results may arise. They came together fortuitously,
blown to one centre by the merest winds of circumstance,
out of circles totally different and unlike. Why it was
that Mr. May, so good a Churchman, permitted two people so
entirely out of his sphere to become his habitual guests and the
companions of his children was very perplexing to the outside
world, who half in mere surprise, and a little in despite, wondered
and commented till they were tired, or till they had become
so familiar with the strange spectacle that it ceased to
strike them. A rich pupil might be forgiven for being a Dissenter,
indeed in Carlingford as elsewhere money made up for
most deficiencies; but even natural complacency towards the
rich pupil scarcely accounted for the reception of the others.
The neighbours could never be quite sure whether the family at
the Parsonage knew or did not know that their new friend
Northcote was not only acting as Minister of Salem Chapel,
but was the assailant of Reginald May at the Anti-Establishment
Meeting, and various persons in Grange Lane held themselves
for a long time on the tip-toe of preparation, ready to
breathe to Mr. May the painful intelligence, in case he was unaware
of it. But he never gave them the opportunity. Honestly,
he had forgotten the speaker's name at first, and only
recognized him when he was introduced by young Copperhead;
and then the situation was piquant and amused him, especially
the evident confusion and consternation of the culprit when
found out.</p>

<p>“I don't know what he thinks he has done to you,” said
Clarence, “I could scarcely make him come in. He says he is
sure you can't wish to see him.”</p>

<p>This was two days after the dinner, when Horace Northcote
came to leave a respectful card, hoping that he might see
Ursula at a door or window. Clarence had seized upon him and
dragged him in, in spite of himself.</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I am very glad to see him,” said Mr. May,
with a smile. He looked at the young Dissenter with a jeer in
his eyes. He liked to punish him, having suddenly perceived
that this jeer was much more potent than any serious penalty.
“If he will promise not to slay me, I shan't quarrel with him.”
Mr. May was in such good spirits at this moment that he could
afford to joke; his own magnanimity, and the other's confused
looks of guilt, overcame his gravity. “Come back again,” he
said, holding out his hand; and though Horace retired for the
moment utterly confounded, yet the attractions of the cheerful
house overcame, after a while, his sense of humiliation and
inappropriateness. If the injured family had condoned his
offence, why should he mind? and the pleasant girlish friendliness,
without any <i>arrière pensée</i>, of Ursula, was enough to have
set any man at his ease; the facts of the case being that Mrs.
Hurst was away upon a long visit, and that, having no other
gossip within the range of her acquaintance, Ursula did not
know. Reginald, who did, had the same sense of magnanimity
as his father had, and began to like the society of the congenial
yet different spirit which it was so strange to him to find under a
guise so unlike his own. And Northcote, on his side, finding no
house to which he could betake himself among those whom
Phœbe called “our own people;” found a refuge, which
gradually became dearer and dearer to him, at the Parsonage,
and in his profound sense of the generosity of the people who
had thus received him, felt his own partizanship wax feebler and
feebler every day. He seemed to see the ground cut from
under his feet, as he watched the young chaplain at his work.
Mr. May, to be sure, was no example of pastoral diligence, but
he was a pleasant companion, and had put himself from the first
in that position of moral superiority which naturally belongs
to an injured person who can forgive heartily and without prejudice.
And Ursula! He did not venture to call her Ursula,
even in the secret depths of his heart. There a pronoun was
enough, as, indeed, incipient Love generally finds it. She
spoke to him, smiled at him in the street; and immediately life
became a <i>Vita Nuova</i> to him. The young Dissenter was as
Dante, and simple Ursula, with her housekeeping books in her
hand, became another Beatrice. It is not every one who has the
capacity for this perfect and absorbing sentiment; but Horace
Northcote had, and for a long time Ursula was as unconscious
of it as heart could desire.</p>

<p>Phœbe's admission to the house had been more simple still.
A girlish fancy on Ursula's part, a fit of good-nature on her
father's, and then that secret thread of connection with Tozer
which no one knew of, and the coming of Clarence Copperhead,
to please whom Mr. May permitted himself to be persuaded
to do much; and in addition to all this, her good looks,
her pretty manners, her cleverness and the deference she had
always shown in the proper quarter. Mr. May did not enter
into the lists with his son, or think of offering himself as a
suitor to Phœbe; but he liked to talk to her, and to watch
what he called “her little ways,” and to hear her play when
Clarence and his violin were otherwise disposed of. He was an
experienced man, priding himself on a knowledge of human
nature, and Phœbe's “little ways” amused him greatly. What
did she mean?—to “catch” Clarence Copperhead, who would
be a great match, or to fascinate Northcote? Oddly enough
Mr. May never thought of Reginald, though that young man
showed an eagerness to talk to Phœbe which was more than
equal with his own, and had always subjects laid up ready to
discuss with her, when he could find the opportunity. Sometimes
he would go up to her in the midst of the little party
and broach one of these topics straight on end, without preface
or introduction, as which was her favourite play of Shakespeare,
and what did she think of the character of King Lear? It
was not very wise, not any wiser than his neighbour was, who
made pretty little Ursula into the ideal lady, the most gentle
and stately figure in poetry; and yet no doubt there was something
in both follies that was a great deal better than wisdom.
The society formed by these two young pairs, with Clarence
Copperhead as a heavy floating balance, and Mr. May and
Janey—one philosophical, wise and mistaken; the other sharp-sighted
and seeing everything—as spectators, was very pleasant
to the close little coterie themselves, and nobody else got within
the charmed circle. They grew more and more intimate daily,
and had a whole vocabulary of domestic jokes and allusions which
no one else could understand. It must be allowed, however,
that the outside world was not pleased with this arrangement
on either side of the question. The Church people were
shocked with the Mays for harbouring Dissenters under any
circumstances whatever, and there had not been a Minister at
Salem Chapel for a long time so unpopular as Horace Northcote,
who was always “engaged” when any of the connection
asked him to tea, and preached sermons which went over their
heads, and did not remember them when he met them in the
street. Tozer was about the only one of the congregation who
stood up for the young man. The others thanked Heaven that
“he was but tempory,” and on the whole they were right, for
certainly he was out of place in his present post.</p>

<p>As for Clarence Copperhead, he led an agreeable life enough
among all these undercurrents of feeling, which he did not
recognise with any distinctness. He was comfortable enough,
pleased with his own importance, and too obtuse to perceive
that he bored his companions; and then he considered himself
to be slightly “sweet upon” both the girls. Ursula was his
favourite in the morning, when he embarrassed her much by
persistently seeking her company whenever liberated by her
father; but Phœbe was the queen of the evening, when he
would get his fiddle with an unfailing complacency which drove
Reginald frantic. Whether it was mere good-nature or any
warmer impulse, Phœbe was strangely tolerant of these fiddlings,
and would go on playing for hours with serene composure,
never tired and never impatient. Yet poor Clarence was not
an accompanyist to be coveted. He was weak in the ear and
defective in science, but full of a cheerful confidence which was
as good as genius.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Miss Phœbe,” he would say cheerfully, when
he had broken down for the twentieth time, “play on and I'll
catch you up.” He had thus a series of trysting places in
every page or two, which might have been very laughable to an
indifferent spectator, but which aggravated the Mays, father
and son, to an intolerable extent. They were the two who
suffered. As for Horace Northcote, who was not a great talker,
it was a not disagreeable shield for his silent contemplation of
Ursula, and the little things which from time to time he
ventured to say to her. For conversation he had not the
thirst which animated Reginald, and Ursula's talk, though
lively and natural, was not like Phœbe's; but while the music
went on he could sit by her in a state of silent beatitude, now
and then saying something to which Ursula replied if she was
disposed, or if she was not disposed put aside by a little shake
of her head, and smiling glance at the piano. Sometimes it
was simple wilfulness that made her silent; but Northcote set
it down to an angelical sweetness which would not wound even
the worst of performances by inattention. They were happy
enough sitting there under the shelter of the piano, the young
man absorbed in the dreams of a young love, the girl just
beginning to realize the adoration which she was receiving,
with a timid perception of it—half-frightened, half-grateful.
She was in spite of herself amused by the idea only half understood,
and which she could scarcely believe, that this big grown
man, so much more important than herself in everybody's eyes,
should show so much respect to a little girl whom her father
scolded, whom Reginald sent trotting about on all sorts of
errands, and whom Cousin Anne and Cousin Sophy considered
a child. It was very strange, a thing to call forth inextinguishable
laughter, and yet with a strange touch of sweetness
in it, which almost made her cry in wondering gratitude.
What she thought of him, Ursula did not ask herself; that he
should think <i>like this</i> of her was the bewildering, extraordinary,
ridiculous fact that at present filled her girlish head.</p>

<p>But if they were sweet to Northcote, these evenings were
the crown of Clarence Copperhead's content and conscious
success; he was supremely happy, caressing his fiddle between
his cheek and his shoulder, and raising his pale eyes to the
ceiling in an ecstasy. The music, and the audience, and the
accompanyist all together were delightful to him. He could
have gone on he felt not only till midnight, but till morning,
and so on to midnight again, with short intervals for refreshment.
Every ten minutes or so there occurred a break in the
continuity of the strain, and a little dialogue between the performers.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I have missed a line; never mind; go on, Miss
Phœbe, I will make up to you,” he said.</p>

<p>“It is those accidentals that have been your ruin,” said
Phœbe laughing; “it is a very hard passage, let us turn back
and begin again,” and then the audience would laugh, not very
sweetly, and (some of them) make acrid observations; but the
pianist was good-nature itself, and went back and counted and
kept time with her head, and with her hand when she could
take it from the piano, until she had triumphantly tided him
over the bad passage, or they had come to the point of shipwreck
again. During these labours, Phœbe, who was really a
good musician, ought to have suffered horribly; but either she
did not, or her good-nature was stronger than her good taste,
for she went on serenely, sometimes for hours together, while
her old and her young admirers sat secretly cursing (in such
ways as are becoming to a clergyman) each in his corner.
Perhaps she had a slight degree of pleasure in the evident
power she had over father and son; but it was difficult fully to
understand her views at this somewhat bewildering period of
her life, in which she was left entirely to her own resources.
She was herself groping a little through paths of uncertain
footing, enjoying herself a great deal, but not seeing clearly
where it led to, and having no definite purpose, or chart of
those unknown countries in her mind.</p>

<p>“How you can go on,” said Reginald, on one of these
occasions, having at length managed to seize upon and get her
into a corner, “for hours, having your ears sacrificed and your
patience tried by these fearful discords, and smile through it, is
a mystery which I cannot fathom! If it was only consideration
for your audience, that might be enough to move any one—but
yourself—”</p>

<p>“I don't seem to feel it so very much myself.”</p>

<p>“And yet you are a musician!”</p>

<p>“Don't be too hard upon me, Mr May. I only play—a
little. I am not like my cousins in the High Street, who are
supposed to be very clever at music; and then poor Mr.
Copperhead is a very old friend.”</p>

<p>“Poor Mr. Copperhead! poor us, you mean, who have to
listen—and you, who choose to play.”</p>

<p>“You are very vindictive,” she said, with a piteous look.
“Why should you be so vindictive? I do what I can to
please my friends, and—there is no doubt about what poor
Clarence likes best; if you were to show me as plainly what
you would like—<i>quite</i> plainly, as he does——”</p>

<p>“Don't you know?” said Reginald, with glowing eyes.
“Ah, well! if I may show you plainly—quite plainly, with the
same results, you may be sure not to be left long in doubt.
Talk to me! it is easier, and not so fatiguing. Here,” said the
young man, placing a chair for her; “he has had your patient
services for two hours. Do only half as much for me.”</p>

<p>“Ah! but talking is a different thing, and more—difficult—and
more—personal. Well!” said Phœbe, with a laugh and
a blush, taking the chair, “I will try, but you must begin;
and I cannot promise, you know, for a whole hour.”</p>

<p>“After you have given that fellow two! and such a fellow!
If it was Northcote, I might be equally jea—displeased, but I
could understand it, for he is not a fool.”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Phœbe, looking towards the other end of the
room, where Northcote was occupied as usual close to Ursula's
work-basket, “that Mr. Northcote manages to amuse himself
very well without any help of mine.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” cried Reginald, startled; for of course it is needless
to say that the idea of any special devotion to his little sister
had never entered his mind. He felt disposed to laugh at first
when the idea was suggested to him, but he gave a second look,
and fellow-feeling threw a certain enlightenment upon the subject.
“That would never do,” he said gravely; “I wonder I
never thought of it before.”</p>

<p>“Why would it not do? She is very nice, and he is clever
and a rising man; and he is very well off; and you said just
now he was not a fool.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless it would never do,” said Reginald, opposing
her pointedly, as he had never opposed her before; and he remained
silent for a whole minute, looking across the room,
during which long interval Phœbe sat demurely on the chair
where he had placed her, looking at him with a smile on her
face.</p>

<p>“Well?” she said at length, softly, “it was talk you said
you wanted, Mr. May; but you are not so ready to tune up
your violin as Mr. Copperhead, though I wait with my fingers
on the piano, so to speak.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon!” he cried, and then their eyes met, and
both laughed, though, as far as Reginald was concerned, in an
embarrassed way.</p>

<p>“You perceive,” said Phœbe, rising, “that it is not nearly so
easy to please you, and that you don't know half so exactly
what you want, as Clarence Copperhead does, though you
abuse him, poor fellow. I have got something to say to Ursula!
though, perhaps, she does not want me any more than you do.”</p>

<p>“Don't give me up for one moment's distraction; and it was
your fault, not mine, for suggesting such a startling idea.”</p>

<p>Phœbe shook her head, and waved her hand as a parting
salutation, and then went across the room to where Ursula was
sitting, where Horace Northcote at least found her very much in
his way. She began at once to talk low and earnestly on some
subject so interesting that it absorbed both the girls in a way
which was very surprising and unpleasant to the young men,
neither of whom had been able to interest the one whose attention
he was specially anxious to secure half so effectually.
Northcote, from the other side of the table, and Reginald from
the other end of the room, gazed and gloomed with discomfited
curiosity, wondering what it could be; while Clarence strutted
uneasily about the piano, taking up his fiddle now and then,
striking a note, and screwing up his strings into concord, with
many impatient glances. But still the girls talked. Was it
about their dresses or some nonsense, or was it a more serious
subject, which could thus be discussed without masculine help?
but this matter they never fathomed, nor have they found out
till this hour.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXI"/>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<h3>SOCIETY.</h3>


<p>Notwithstanding such little social crosses, however, the
society at the Parsonage, as thus constituted, was very agreeable.
Mr. May, though he had his faults, was careful of his
daughter. He sat in the drawing-room every evening till she
retired, on the nights their visitors came, and even when it
was Clarence only who remained, an inmate of the house, and
free to go and come as he pleased. Ursula, he felt, must not
be left alone, and though it is uncertain whether she fully appreciated
the care he took of her, this point in his character is
worth noting. When the young party went out together, to
skate, for instance, as they did, for several merry days, Reginald
and Janey were, he considered, sufficient guardians for their
sister. Phœbe had no chaperon—“Unless you will take that
serious office upon you, Ursula,” she said, shrugging her
shoulders prettily; but she only went once or twice, so well
was she able, even when the temptation was strongest, to
exercise self-denial, and show her perfect power of self-guidance.
As for old Tozer and his wife, the idea of a chaperon never
entered their homely head. Such articles are unnecessary in
the lower levels of society. They were anxious that their child
should enjoy herself, and could not understand the reason of
her staying at home on a bright frosty day, when the Mays
came to the door in a body to fetch her.</p>

<p>“No, if they'd have gone down on their knees, nor if I had
gone down on mine, would that girl have left me,” cried the old
lady, with tears in her eyes. “She do behave beautiful to her old
granny. If so be as I haven't a good night, no power on earth
would make that child go pleasuring. It's 'most too much at
her age.”</p>

<p>But Phœbe confided to Ursula that it was not altogether
anxiety about her grandmother.</p>

<p>“I have nobody of my own to go with. If I took grandpapa
with me, I don't think it would mend matters. Once or
twice it was possible, but not every day. Go and enjoy yourself,
dear,” she said, kissing her friend.</p>

<p>Ursula was disposed to cry rather than to enjoy herself, and
appealed to Reginald, who was deeply touched by Phœbe's fine
feeling. He took his sister to the ice, but that day he went so
far as to go back himself to No. 6, actually into the house, to
make a humble protest, yet to insinuate his admiration. He
was much impressed by, and approved highly of this reticence,
having a very high standard of minor morals for ladies, in his
mind, like most young men.</p>

<p>“She is not one of the girls who rush about everywhere, and
whom one is sick of seeing,” he said.</p>

<p>“I think it is very silly,” cried Janey. “Who cares for a
chaperon! and why shouldn't Phœbe have her fun, like the rest,
instead of shutting herself up in a stuffy room with that dreadful
old Mrs. Tozer?”</p>

<p>Her brother reproved her so sharply for this speech that
Janey withdrew in tears, still asking “Why?” as she rushed
to her room. Clarence Copperhead, for his part, stroked his
moustache and said it was a bore.</p>

<p>“For she is the best skater of all the ladies here,” he said.
“I beg your pardon, Miss Ursula. She's got so much go in
her, and keeps it up like fun. She's the best I know for keeping
a fellow from getting tired; but as it's Thursday, I suppose
she'll be there in the evening.”</p>

<p>Clarence never called them anything but Miss Ursula and
Miss Phœbe, dropping the prefix in his thoughts. He felt
that he was “a little sweet upon” them both; and, indeed,
it had gleamed dully across his mind that a man who could
marry them both need never be bored, but was likely always
to find something “to do.” Choice, however, being necessary,
he did not see his way so clearly as to which he would choose.
“The mountain sheep are sweeter, but the valley sheep are
fatter,” he said to himself, if not in these immortal words, yet
with full appreciation of the sentiment. Ursula began to
understand dinners with a judicious intelligence, which he felt
was partly created by his own instructions and remarks; but
in the evening it was Phœbe who reigned supreme. She was
so sensible that most likely she could invent a <i>menu</i> all out of
her own head, he thought, feeling that the girl who got him
through the “Wedding March” with but six mistakes, was
capable of any intellectual feat. He had not the slightest
doubt that it was in his power to marry either of the girls as
soon as he chose to intimate his choice; and in the mean time
he found it very agreeable to maintain a kind of mental possibility
of future proprietorship of them both.</p>

<p>And thus the pleasant life ran on in the most agreeable
absorption and abstraction from the world outside. “Don't
ask any one else; why should we have any one else?” they
all said, except Janey, who had condescended to appear in the
evening in her best frock, though she was not admitted at dinner,
and who thought a few additional guests, and a round
game now and then, would be delightful variations upon the
ordinary programme; but the others did not agree with her.
They became more and more intimate, mingling the brother
and sister relationship with a something unnamed, unexpressed,
which gave a subtle flavour to their talks and flirtations. In
that incipient stage of love-making this process is very pleasant
even to the spectators, full of little excitements and surprises,
and sharp stings of momentary quarrel, and great revolutions,
done with a single look, which are infinitely amusing to the
lookers-on. The house became a real domestic centre, thought
of by each and all with tender sentiment, such as made its
owners somewhat proud of it, they could scarcely tell why.
Even Mr. May felt a certain complacence in the fact that the
young men were so fond of the Parsonage, and when he heard
complaints of the coldness and dullness of domestic intercourse,
smiled, and said that he did not feel it so, with that pleasant
sense of something superior in himself to cause this difference,
which is sweet to the greatest Stoic; for he was not as yet enlightened
as to the entire indifference of the little circle to any
charm in him, and would have been utterly confounded had
any one told him that to the grave and reflective Northcote,
whom he had treated with such magnanimous charity, binding
him (evidently) by bonds of gratitude to himself for ever, it
was little Ursula, and not her father, who was the magnet of
attraction. Mr. May was a clever man, and yet it had not
occurred to him that any comparison between his own society
and that of Ursula was possible. Ursula! a child! He would
have laughed aloud at the thought.</p>

<p>But all this pleasant society, though father and daughter
both agreed that it cost nothing, for what is a cake and a cup
of tea? and the late dinners and the extra maid, and the additional
fires, and general enlargement of expenditure made
immense inroads, it must be allowed, into the additional income
brought by Clarence Copperhead. The first quarter's payment
was spent, and more than spent, before it came. The money
that was to be laid up for that bill of Tozer's—perhaps—had
now no saving peradventure left in it; for the second half
would not be due till two months after the Tozer bill, and
would but be half, even if procurable at once. Mr. May felt
a slight shock while this gleamed across his mind, but only for a
moment. There was still a month, and a month is a long time,
and in the mean time James was almost certain to send something,
and his Easter offerings might, probably would, this year be something
worth having. Why they should be better than usual this
year Mr. May did not explain to himself; his head was a little
turned it must be supposed by the momentary chance of having
more money in his hands than he used to have. Already he had
got into the habit of ordering what he wanted somewhat recklessly,
without asking himself how the things he ordered were to be
paid for, and, as so often happened, followed up that first tampering
with the rules of right and wrong by a general recklessness
of the most dangerous kind. He was not so much alone as he
had been; his house, in which he was infinitely more amiable
than of old, had become more pleasant to him; he liked his life
better. His son was independent with an income of his own,
and therefore he felt much more respect for him, and treated
him as a companion. His daughter had developed, if not in
the way of <i>entrées</i>, a talent for dinners which raised her very
much in his eyes; and naturally the regard shown to her by
the visitors reacted upon Mr. May, though it had not crossed
his mind as yet that any one could be in love with Ursula.
All this made him happier in spite of himself. When you
begin to esteem and be proud of your children your life is
naturally happier than when you scoff and jeer at them, and treat
them as creatures of inferior mould to yourself. Mr. May
found out all at once that Reginald was a fine young fellow,
that Ursula was pretty and pleasant, and that droll Janey, with
her elf-locks and angles, was amusing at least, if no more. As
for the little ones, they were considerably thrust into a corner
when the elder youth forced itself into the front. They learned
their lessons in corners, and had their tea by themselves, and
were much humbled and subdued from the moment in which
their school-books and toys had meandered over the whole house,
and their looks and likings had been just as important as anything
else. When there is no mother to protect them, the
elder sister's first lover marks a terribly critical period for the
children of the house. They were banished from the drawing-room,
except on special occasions, when they came <i>en grande
tenue</i>, in their best things, and were jeered at by Mr. Copperhead.
He called them “the kids,” both Amy and Robin were
aware, and they resented it unspeakably. Thus the inward
happiness of the Mays confined itself to the upper regions of
the family. Even Betsy regretted the days when, if she had
more to do, she had at least “her kitchen to herself,” and
nobody to share the credit. There was more fuss and more
worry, if a trifle less labour, and the increase in consequence
which resulted from being called cook, instead of maid-of-all-work,
was scarcely so sweet in possession as had seemed in
prospect.</p>

<p>“Them late dinners” were the object of her perpetual railings;
“oh, how much more comfortable it was, if gentry would
but think so, to have your dinner at two, and get done with
your washing up before you was cleaned, or had any occasion
to bother yourself about your cap!” When little Amy cried
over the loneliness of “the children's tea,” which they frequently
had to pour out for themselves, Betty gave her a cake
and a kiss, and felt disposed to cry too.</p>

<p>“And she don't know, poor child, not the half,” said Betty,
which was a kind of oracular sentence difficult for Betty herself
to understand. The children had nothing to do with the
late dinner; they were sent to bed earlier than they used to be,
and scolded if any distant sounds of romps made itself audible
at seven o'clock when their elders were dining; and then when
the little ones went injured to bed, and Johnnie, indignant,
worked at his lessons by himself in a corner of the old nursery,
deeply aware that his school-boy boots and jacket were quite
unfit for the drawing-room, the grown-up young people ran
lightly upstairs, all smiles and pleasure, and those delightful
evenings began.</p>

<p>The children sometimes could not get to sleep for the piano
and the raspings of the fiddle, which sounds of mirth suggested
nothing but the wildest enjoyment to them; and when the door
opened now and then, bursts of laughter and mingling voices
would come out like the sounds the Peri heard at the gates of
Paradise. The elder ones were happy; their little atoms of
individual life had all united for the moment into one sunshiny
and broad foundation, on which everything seemed to rest with
that strange sense of stability and continuance, which such a
moment of happiness, though it carries every element of change
in it, almost invariably brings. It felt as if it might go on for
ever, and yet the very sentiment that inspired it made separation
and convulsion inevitable—one of those strange paradoxes
which occur every day.</p>

<p>Thus the year crept round, and winter melted away with all
its amusements, and spring began. Mr. Northcote's time at
Salem Chapel was more than half over, a fact on which the
congregation congratulated itself much.</p>

<p>“If so be as he had a settled charge of his own, I shouldn't
be sorry to see him gone to-morrow,” said one of the recent
members.</p>

<p>“Settled charge! You take my word,” said Mrs. Pigeon,
who was getting old, but always continued a woman of spirit,
“he'll never have a settled charge in our connection. He
carries on here, 'cause he can't help hisself, but he ain't cut out
for a pastor, and he's a deal too thick with them Church folks.
A parson, too! I'd 'a thought he had more pride.”</p>

<p>“Nay, now, but I don't wish him no harm,” said the first
speaker; “he's a civil spoken gentleman if he ain't so free and
so pleasant as a body looks for.”</p>

<p>“Civil spoken!” said the other; “one of our own ministers
in our own connection! Bless you! they're our servants, that's
what they are. I'd like to see one on 'em as 'ud take upon him
to be civil spoken to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn't go as far as that,” cried Mrs. Brown; “we
pays 'em their salary, and we 'as a right to a civil word: but a
minister's a minister, and I'll show him respect as long as he
deserves it. I ain't one for being too hard upon ministers,
especially when they're young men, as has their temptations
like, we all know.”</p>

<p>“I don't know what you call temptations,” said Mrs. Pigeon;
“licking the dust under the feet of a Church parson! and after
speaking up so bold against young May and them old cheats
at the College. I wish he was gone from here, that's what I
wish, and our old pastor (if we can't get none better) back
again. He was one as knew his place, and wouldn't have set
his foot inside one of them Parsonages. Parsonages, indeed!
kept up with our money. If ever there was an iniquity on this
earth it's a State Church, and all the argufying in the world
won't put that out of me.”</p>

<p>It happened that Northcote was in the poulterer's shop,
talking to the poulterer himself at this moment, and he heard
the conclusion of this speech delivered with much unction and
force. Such sentiments would have charmed him three months
ago, and probably he would have thought this uneducated but
strenuous partisan an extremely intelligent woman. He hurried
away now with an uncomfortable smile. If an opinion is the
right opinion, why should it have an air of absurdity thrown
upon it by being thus uttered in ungrammatical language by a
poulterer's wife? Truth is the same by whomsoever stated;
but yet, was not dogmatism on any subject the sign of an inexperienced
and uncultivated, or a rude and untutored mind?
What did this woman know of the Parsonage, which she
supposed she helped to pay for? What had he himself known
three months ago of Reginald May, whom he had assaulted so
savagely? This Church family, which Mrs. Pigeon knew no
better than to abuse, with what divine charity it had received
himself, notwithstanding his public sin against it. When he
thought of that public sin, Northcote's countenance glowed
with shame, and it continued to glow with a more agreeable
warmth when he escaped into thought of the goodness which
the Mays had shown him. Had there ever been such goodness?
Was there ever so sweet a home of the heart as that faded,
homely drawing-room? His heart beat high, his steps quickened;
they carried him down Grange Lane in a path so often
trod that he felt there must be a special track of his own under
the garden walls, going Parsonage way.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXII"/>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<h3>LOVE-MAKING.</h3>


<p>Mrs. Sam Hurst had been a long time out of Carlingford;
she had been paying visits among her friends, with whom,
though the young Mays would never believe it, she was very
popular, for she was not ill-natured in her gossip, and she was
often amusing in the fulness of her interest in other people.
It was April when she came back, and the early warmth and
softness of the spring were beginning to be felt in Grange
Lane; the doors of the houses began to be left open, and the
girls at the Parsonage had taken to running out and in without
their hats, gleaming through the little shrubbery in front, and
round to the back garden. One evening it was so mild that
they all (which comprehensive term, sometimes extended to
“the whole party,” began to be commonly used among them
with that complacence in the exclusiveness of their little coterie,
which every “set” more or less feels) came downstairs in a
body, and wandered about among the laurel-bushes in the
spring moonlight. There was Ursula and Mr. Northcote,
Phœbe and Reginald, and Clarence Copperhead, with Janey
behind, who followed where they went, but did not enjoy the
ceremony. It was bad enough in the drawing-room; but
moonlight, who cared about moonlight? Janey said to herself
indignantly. She was the only one who looked up to Mrs.
Hurst's window, where there was a faint light, and when the
voices became audible Janey perceived some one come behind
the curtain and look out. The girl was divided between her
faithful family feud against Mrs. Hurst, and a vague sense of
satisfaction in her presence as a Marplot, who one way or other
would infallibly interfere.</p>

<p>“She will say something to papa,” said Janey, her heart involuntary
rising at the thought, though at the same time she
shivered to think of the treachery involved to all the tenets of
the family. Janey sat on the steps and listened to the others
talking. No one pointed out the stars to her, or followed her
about as Reginald followed Phœbe. As for Mr. Copperhead,
Janey thought he was almost as lonely as she was. He had
lighted his cigar, and was strolling up and down, interrupting
both of the other pairs occasionally, breaking into the midst
of Northcote's astronomical lecture abruptly, and stopping
Phœbe herself in the middle of a sentence. Janey, watching
sharply from the steps, noticed, as a spectator has it in her
power to do, that whereas Northcote was extremely impatient
of the interruption, and discovered immediately that the stars
could be seen better from another spot, Phœbe took it quite
sweetly, and addressed herself to him as she went on, which
Reginald did not like, Janey was sure. Were they in love
with each other? the girl asked herself—was this how it was
managed? When the moon went under a cloud for a moment
Clarence Copperhead's vast shirt-front made a kind of substitute
down below. Janey lost the other two among the
bushes, but she always beheld that orb of white moving backward
and forward with two dark figures near. She felt sure
Reginald did not want to have him in such close neighbourhood;
but Phœbe's voice went on talking to both alike.
Janey was half-pleased, and half-indignant. She had a jealous
dislike, such as most girls have, to see her brother engrossed
by any one, but no more did she like to see another man preferred
to Reginald; she was jealous both ways. As she sat
and watched, a slight little creak came to her sharp ears, and
looking up she saw Mrs. Hurst's drawing-room window opened
the very least little bit in the world. Ah! Janey said, with a
long breath. There was nothing she would not have given to
have talked it all over with Mrs. Hurst, and to hear what she
would say, if she had not been the traditional adversary against
whom all the family steeled their hearts.</p>

<p>That was a very pleasant evening; they all remembered it
afterwards. It was the moment when Ursula discovered all
in the darkness, when the moon was under that cloud, <i>what
Mr. Northcote meant</i>. It flashed upon her like a sudden light,
though they were standing in the shade of a great laurel. He
did not make any declaration, nor say a word that she could
remember. And yet all at once, by some magic which is not
explainable, she found out that that was what he was meaning.
This is not an admirable sentence; but it is difficult to know
how to put it better. It was quite a strange discovery. It set her
heart beating, thumping against her breast. She herself meant
nothing whatever, and she never thought of any response,
or of the time when he might ask her to make a response.
The sensation of the moment was quite enough for Ursula.
She was greatly startled, surprised, yet not surprised, touched
and full of a wondering respect and sympathy, awe and half-amusement.
Could it be possible, was <i>that</i> what it was?
Though he was not conscious of betraying himself in any way,
Northcote thought he had done something to offend her. Her
shy silence and withdrawal from him went to his heart; never
had her society been so sweet, never had he had her so completely
to himself. What had he done to alarm or offend her?
He went home with his head full of this, able to think of
nothing else.</p>

<p>And Phœbe went home too, escorted by Reginald and Clarence
together, to her grandfather's door, with her head buzzing
with many thoughts. It was not her heart that was in a commotion,
like little Ursula's. She was more experienced, though
she was not much older, and had gone through such discoveries
before now. But a much more perplexing accident had
befallen her. Reginald May had fallen in love with her, and
Clarence Copperhead, after considerable resistance and hanging
off, was making up his mind to propose. Yes. Phœbe felt
with unerring instinct that this was the state of affairs. He
was making up his mind to propose. So much of her and so little
of her had at length made an end of all the prudent hesitations
that lay under the crisp pie-crust of that starched and dazzling
shirt front. That he should never be able to speak a word to
her without that May! that fellow! “the son of my coach!”
poking himself in, was a thing which at length had fired his
cool blood to fever heat. Nobody else could play his accompaniments
like that, or pull him through the “Wedding
March” like that; and who would look better at the head of a
table, or show better at a ball, or get on better in society?
No one he knew, certainly. It was true she was only a
Minister's daughter, and without a penny; for the little fortune
Mr. and Mrs. Beecham had carefully gathered together
and preserved for their daughter, what was that to the Copperheads?—nothing,
not a penny. But, on the other hand,
Clarence felt that he himself, or rather his father, was
rich enough to be able to afford a wife without money. There
was no reason why he should marry money; and a wife like
Phœbe, what a relief that would be, in the way of education!
No need of any more coaching. She was clever, and fond of
reading, and so forth. She would get everything up for him,
if he went into parliament, or that sort of thing; why, she'd
keep him posted up. “There ain't many girls that could do
that,” he said to himself. She would save him worlds of
trouble; save his money even, for coaches and that sort of
thing cost money; and then that fellow May would be out of
it; his nose would be put out of joint. These are not eloquent
sentiments, but so it was that Clarence's natural feelings
expressed themselves. He had intimated that he would see
Miss Phœbe home, but May had stalked out side by side with
him—had not left them for a moment; and Clarence determined
that he would not stand it any longer. If there was
no other way of shaking this fellow off, why, then he would
make up his mind to it, and propose.</p>

<p>Phœbe somehow saw all this written in his fine countenance,
and she saw at the same time that poor Reginald, who was (she
thought) young and simple, and just the sort of poor boy to
yield to such folly, was in love with her; and her head was
buzzing with the double discovery. The first was (of course)
the most important. She had no time to indulge her thoughts
while she walked up between them, keeping them in play each
with a word, talking all the way to fill up the somewhat sulky
silence between them; but when she got safely within the
garden door, and heard it shut behind her, and found herself
in the quiet of the little green enclosure, with the budding trees
and the lilac bushes for her only companions, the relief was
very grateful to her. She could not go in all at once to make
conversation for grandpapa and grandmamma, and give them
the account they liked to hear, of how she had “enjoyed herself.”
She took off her hat to be cooler, and walked slowly
down under the moonlight, her head all throbbing and rustling
with thought. The paths were bordered with primroses, which
made a pale glimmer in the moon, and shed a soft fragrance
about. Phœbe had nothing to appeal to Heaven about, or to
seek counsel from Nature upon, as sentimental people might do.
She took counsel with herself, the person most interested.
What was the thing she ought to do? Clarence Copperhead
was going to propose to her. She did not even take the
trouble of saying to herself that he loved her; it was Reginald
who did that, a totally different person, but yet the other was
more urgent. What was Phœbe to do? She did not dislike
Clarence Copperhead, and it was no horror to her to think of
marrying him. She had felt for years that this might be on
the cards, and there were a great many things in it which demanded
consideration. He was not very wise, nor a man to
be enthusiastic about, but he would be a career to Phœbe.
She did not think of it humbly like this, but with a big capital—a
Career. Yes; she could put him into parliament, and
keep him there. She could thrust him forward (she believed)
to the front of affairs. He would be as good as a profession, a
position, a great work to Phœbe. He meant wealth (which
she dismissed in its superficial aspect as something meaningless
and vulgar, but accepted in its higher aspect as an almost
necessary condition of influence), and he meant all the possibilities
of future power. Who can say that she was not as
romantic as any girl of twenty could be? only her romance
took an unusual form. It was her head that was full of throbbings
and pulses, not her heart. No doubt there would be
difficulties and disagreeables. His father would oppose it, and
Phœbe felt with a slight shiver that his father's opposition was
nothing to be laughed at, and that Mr. Copperhead had it in
him to crush rebellion with a ferocious hand. And would
Clarence have strength of mind or spirit to hold out? This
was a very serious question, and one which included all the
rest. If she accepted his proposal, would he have the heart to
stand to it against his father? or would her consent simply
involve her in a humiliating struggle which would end in defeat?
That was the great question. If this should be the case, what
use would there be in any sacrifice that Phœbe might make?
A struggle with Mr. Copperhead would affect her father's position
as much or more than her own, and she knew that a
great many of the congregation would infallibly side with Mr.
Copperhead, feeling it a most dangerous precedent that a
pastor's daughter should be encouraged to think herself eligible
for promotion so great, and thus interfere with the more suitable
matrimonial prospects of wealthy young men who might
happen to attend her father's chapel. Such a thing the conscript
fathers of the connection would feel ought to be put a
stop to with a high hand. So it may be supposed that Phœbe
had enough to think of, as she strolled about in the moonlight
alone, between the two borders of primroses. Tozer thought
she had gone upstairs to take off her “things,” and it was
natural that when a girl got before a looking-glass she should
forget the progress of time; so that he merely wondered at
her non-appearance until the little chill of air stole in from
the open door, and made Mrs. Tozer cough.</p>

<p>“If it ain't our Phœbe a-walking about in the moonlight
like a play-actor!” said Tozer, in consternation, drawing aside
the curtain to look out. “I'll tell you what, old woman, the
girl's in love; and that's what it is.” He thought this was a
capital joke, and followed his witticism with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Not much wonder, neither, with all them young fellows
about,” said the old lady. “You may laugh; but, Tozer, I ain't
so easy in my mind as you. If it's him as they call Northcote,
that don't matter; but if it's that big gabby of a Copperhead,
there's troubles a-coming; though he's as rich, they do say, as
Creases, whoever Creases might be, and it would be a credit to
have the girl make a match like that out of our house.”</p>

<p>Whereat Tozer again laughed loud and long.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “if Mister Creases himself was here, I
wouldn't say as he was a bit too good for our Phœbe. Don't
you trouble your head, old woman; Copperhead or t'other one,
let her make her choice. Phœbe junior's the girl as'll be their
match, and you may take my word for that. Phœbe's the one
as will keep them in their right place, whoever they may be.”</p>

<p>Phœbe heard this laugh echo out into the quiet of the night.
Of course, she did not know the cause of it, but it disturbed
her in her thoughts. Poor, kind, excellent grandpapa, she said
to herself, how would he get on with Mr. Copperhead? He
would touch his forelock to so rich a man. He would go down
metaphorically upon his knees before so much wealth; and
what a fool Clarence would be thought on every side for wanting
to marry her! Even his mother, who was a romantic
woman, would not see any romance in it if it was she, Phœbe,
who was the poor girl whom he wanted to marry. Ursula
might have been different, who was a clergyman's daughter, and
consequently a lady by prescriptive right. But herself, Tozer's
granddaughter, Tom Tozer's niece, fresh from the butter-shop,
as it were, and redolent of that petty trade which big trade
ignores, as much as the greatest aristocrat does! Phœbe was
too sensible by far to vex or distress herself on this point, but
she recognised it without any hesitation, and the question remained—was
it for her advantage to enter upon this struggle,
about which there could be no mistake, or was it not? And
this question was very difficult. She did not dislike Clarence,
but then she was not in love with him. He would be a Career,
but he was not a Passion, she said to herself with a smile; and
if the struggle should not turn out successful on her part, it
would involve a kind of ruin, not to herself only, but to all concerned.
What, then, was she to do? The only thing Phœbe
decided upon was that, if she did enter upon that struggle, it
<i>must</i> be successful. Of this alone there could be no manner of
doubt.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"/>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<h3>A DISCLOSURE.</h3>


<p>“Well, young ladies!” said Mrs. Sam Hurst, “I left you
very quiet, but there seems to be plenty going on now-a-days.
What a beautiful moon there was last night! I put up my
window to look at it, and all at once I found there was a party
going on below. Quite a <i>fête champêtre</i>. I have newly come
from abroad, you know, and it seemed quite congenial. I
actually rubbed my eyes, and said to myself, 'I can't have come
home. It's Boulogne still, it isn't Carlingford!'”</p>

<p>“There was no company,” said Ursula with dignity; “there
was only our own party. A friend of Reginald's and a friend
of mine join us often in the evening, and there is papa's pupil—if
you call that a party. We are just as quiet as when you
went away. We never invite strangers. We are as much by
ourselves as ever.”</p>

<p>“With a friend of Reginald's, and a friend of yours, and
papa's pupil!” said Mrs. Hurst, laughing; “double your own
number, Ursula! and I don't suppose Janey counts yet. Why,
there is a young man too many. How dare you waste the gifts
of Providence, you prodigal child? And now let me hear who
they are.”</p>

<p>“You may say Janey doesn't count,” cried that young
woman in person. “Oh, Mrs. Hurst, what a bore they are!
If that's society, I don't care for society. One always following
Ursula about whenever she moves, so that you can't say a word
to her; and the others pulling poor Phœbe to pieces, who hates
them, I am sure. Phœbe was so jolly at first. She would talk to
you, or she would play for you! Why, she taught Johnnie and
me a part-song to sing with her, and said he had a delightful
voice; but she never has any time to look at us now,” said
Janey, stopping in this breathless enumeration of wrongs. “She
is always taken up with those horrible men.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you call Reginald a horrible man?” said Ursula,
with rising colour. “If that was my opinion of my own brother,
I should take care not to say it, at least.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Reginald isn't the worst! There's your Mr. Northcote,
and there's that Copperhead—Woodenhead, we call him
in the nursery. Oh, how papa can put up with him, I can't
tell! he never had any patience with us. You can't think how
dull he is, Mrs. Hurst! I suppose girls don't mind when a
man <i>goes on</i>, whether he's stupid or not. I never heard Mr.
Northcote say much that was interesting either; but he looks
clever, and that is always something.”</p>

<p>“So Mr. Northcote is Ursula's one,” said Mrs. Hurst,
laughing. “You are a perfect jewel, Janey, and I don't know
how I should ever find out anything that's going on, but for
you. Northcote! it is a new name in Carlingford. I wonder
I have not heard of him already; or have you kept him entirely
to yourself, and let nobody know that there was a new man in
the place?”</p>

<p>There was a little pause here. The girls knew nothing about
Northcote, except the one fact that he was a Dissenter; but
as Mrs. Hurst was an excellent Churchwoman, much better
than they were, who had, perhaps, been brought up too completely
under the shadow of the Church to believe in it implicitly,
they hesitated before pronouncing before her that
unfortunate name.</p>

<p>“I don't know whether you are aware,” Ursula said at last,
with some slowness and reluctance, “that papa's pupil is of a
Dissenting family. He is related, through his mother, to our
cousins, the Dorsets.” (This fact Ursula put forth with a little
triumph, as refuting triumphantly any ready conclusion as to the
social standing of Dissenters.) “I think Mr. Northcote came
first to the house with Mr. Copperhead. He is a Dissenter too.”</p>

<p>“Why, Ursula,” cried Mrs. Hurst, “not the man who
attacked Reginald in the Meeting? It was all in the papers.
He made a frightful violent speech about the College and the
sinecure, and what a disgraceful thing it was that your brother,
a young man, could accept it. You don't mean him?”</p>

<p>Ursula was struck dumb. She looked up at her questioner
with her lips falling apart a little, with a look of mingled consternation
and fear.</p>

<p>“Of course it can't be,” said the gossip, who was not ill-natured.
“You never read the papers, but your papa does,
and so does Reginald. Oh, you may be sure it is some other
Northcote, though I don't know the name.”</p>

<p>“Ursula doesn't like to tell you,” said Janey; “but he's
the Dissenting Minister, I know he is. Well! I don't care!
He is just as good as anybody else. I don't go in for your
illiberal ways of thinking, as if no one was worth talking to
except in the Church. Mr. Northcote is very nice. I don't
mind what you say. Do you mean to tell me that all those
curates and people who used to plague our lives out were nicer?
Mr. Saunders, for instance; he is a real good Churchman, I
have always heard people say—”</p>

<p>“Hold your tongue, Janey; you don't know anything about
it,” said Mrs. Hurst, whom this wonderful disclosure elevated
into authority. “A Dissenting Minister! Ah, me! what a
thing it is for you poor girls to have no mother. I did not
think your papa would have had so little consideration as to
expose you to society like that. But men are so thoughtless.”</p>

<p>“I don't know what right you have to speak of exposing
us to society like that,” cried Ursula, quivering all over with
sudden excitement.</p>

<p>She felt as if some one had dug a knife into her, and turned
it round in the wound.</p>

<p>“Men have so little consideration,” repeated Mrs. Hurst,
“especially when a girl is concerned. Though how your papa
could have received a man who made such an assault upon him—even
if he had passed over the attack upon Reginald, he was
attacked himself.”</p>

<p>“It must be a mistake,” said Ursula, growing pale. Her
hands came together half-unconsciously, and clasped in a mute
gesture of appeal. “It is not possible; it cannot be true.”</p>

<p>“Well, it is very odd that your papa should show such
charity, I allow. I don't think it is in human nature. And
Reginald, what does Reginald say? If it is that man, it will
be the strangest thing I ever heard of. But there could not
be two Northcotes, Dissenting Ministers in Carlingford, could
there? It is very strange. I can't think what your papa can
have had in his head. He is a man who would do a thing for
a deep reason, whether he liked it or not. How did this Mr.
Northcote come first here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it was through Mr. Copperhead,” said Janey. “It was
the first dinner-party we had. You should have seen the
fright Ursula was in! And papa would not let me come to
dinner, which was a horrid shame. I am sure I am big enough,
bigger than Ursula.”</p>

<p>“If he came with the pupil, that makes it all quite plain. I
suppose your papa did not want to quarrel with his pupil.
What a predicament for him, if that was the case! Poor Mr.
May! Of course, he did not want to be uncivil. Why, it was
in the 'Gazette,' and the 'Express,' and all the papers; an
account of the Meeting, and that speech, and then a leading
article upon it. I always file the 'Express,' so you can see it
if you like. But what an embarrassment for your poor papa,
Ursula, that you should have taken this man up! And Reginald,
how could he put up with it, a touchy young man, always
ready to take offence? You see now the drawback of not paying
a little attention to what is going on round you. How
uncomfortable you must have made them! It might be very
well to look over an offence, not to be unpleasant to the stranger;
but that you should have thoughtlessly led this man on into the
position of an intimate—”</p>

<p>“I did nothing of the sort,” cried Ursula, growing red and
growing pale, starting up from her work with a sense of the
intolerable which she could not restrain. “What have I done
to be spoken of so? I never led him on, or any one. What
you say is cruel, very cruel! and it is not true.”</p>

<p>“Isn't it true that he was here last night, following you about,
as Janey says? Oh, I know how these sort of things go on.
But you ought to think of your papa's position, and you ought
to think of Reginald. If it was to come to the Bishop's ears
that St. Roque's Parsonage was a refuge for Dissenters! For
I know who <i>your</i> friend is, Ursula! That Tozer girl, another
of them! Indeed, I assure you, it makes me feel very uncomfortable.
And Reginald, just at the very beginning of his career.”</p>

<p>Ursula did not make any reply. She bent her head down
over her work, so low that her flushed cheeks could scarcely
be seen, and went on stitching with energy and passion such
as needles and thread are seldom the instruments of; and yet
how much passion is continually worked away through needles
and thread! Mrs. Hurst sat still for some time, looking at her,
very little satisfied to keep silence, but feeling that she had
discharged an efficient missile, and biting her lips not to say
more to weaken its effect. When some time had passed in this
way, and it was apparent that Ursula had no intention of
breaking the silence, her visitor got up and shook out her skirts
with a little flutter of indignation.</p>

<p>“You are offended,” she said, “though I must say it is very
ill on your part to be offended. What motive can I have but
your good, and regard for your poor dear papa? It is he that
is always the victim, poor man, whether it is your vagaries he
has to pay for, or Reginald's high-flying. Oh, yes; you may
be as angry as you like, Ursula; but you will find out the
difference if your encouragement of this Dissenter interferes
with something better—a living for Reginald, perhaps, or better
preferment for your poor papa.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Janey, awe-stricken; “but after all, it was not
Ursula; it was papa himself. I think he must have done it
to please Mr. Copperhead; for, Mrs. Hurst, you know Mr.
Copperhead is very important. We have all to give in to him.
He pays papa three hundred a-year.”</p>

<p>“Three thousand wouldn't make up for it if it spoilt all your
career,” cried the indignant woman, and she swept away without
saying any more to Ursula, who kept quite still over her
work without budging. Janey went downstairs meekly after
her to open the door, whispering an entreaty that she would
not be angry.</p>

<p>“No, no, I am not angry,” said Mrs. Hurst, “but I shall
keep it up for a day or two. It is the best thing for her. I
think she was struck with what I said.”</p>

<p>Janey stole upstairs again, feeling rather guilty; but Ursula
took little notice of her. The dinner was ordered and everything
settled for the day. She was busy with her week's
mending and darning, with the stockings and other things
in a big basket beside her. When she came to some articles
belonging to Janey, she threw them out with great impatience.</p>

<p>“You may surely mend your things yourself, you are big
enough. You can talk for yourself and me too,” cried Ursula
with sudden impetuosity; and then she sat and worked, her
needle flying through the meshes of her darning, though it is
hard to darn stockings in that impassioned way. They were
socks of Johnnie's, however, with holes in the heels that you
could put your fist through, and the way in which the big
spans filled themselves up under this influence was wonderful
to see. Janey, who was not fond of mending, set to work quite
humbly under the influence of this example, and made two or
three attempts to begin a conversation but without avail.</p>

<p>The girls were seated thus in a disturbed and restless
silence, working as if for their lives, when the usual little jar of
the gate and sound of the bell downstairs announced a visitor.
On ordinary occasions, they were both in the habit of rushing
to the window when the gate was opened to see who was
coming, and Janey had thrown aside her work to do so when a
look from Ursula stopped her. High-spirited as Janey was,
she did not dare to disobey that look. By right of the passion
that had got possession of her, Ursula took the absolute command
of the situation in a way she had never done before, and
some sudden intuition made her aware who it was who was
coming. The girls both sat there still and breathless, waiting
for his appearance. He never came in the day, never had
been seen in the Parsonage at that hour before, and yet Ursula
was as certain who it was as if she had seen him a mile off.
He came into the room, himself looking a little breathless and
disturbed, and gave a quick impatient look at Janey as he went
up to her sister. Ursula saw it and understood well enough.
Janey was in his way; he had come this morning with a
special purpose. Her heart sank down to her very shoes, and
then rose again with a feverish and unreal leap. Was it not
her duty to take the initiative, to cut away the very ground
from beneath his feet? He took a seat, not far from where
she was sitting, and made an effort to begin a little ordinary
conversation, throwing frequent glances at Janey. He said it
was a fine day, which was self-evident; that he almost feared
they would be out; that he had come to—to tell her something
he had forgotten last night, about—yes, about—Cassiopeia's
chair, to correct what he said about Orion—yes, that was it;
and again he looked at Janey, who saw his looks, and wondered
much what she ought to do—go away, as he evidently wished
her, or stay and listen, which was the eager desire of her mind.
When Ursula lifted her head from her darning, and looked at
him with cheeks alternately white and crimson, Janey felt
herself grow hot and breathless with kindred excitement, and
knew that the moment had come.</p>

<p>“Mr. Northcote,” said Ursula, looking at him fixedly, so
fixedly that a nervous trembling ran over him, “I have a question
to ask you. You have been coming to us very often, and
perhaps papa may know, but I don't. Is it true that you
made a speech about Reginald when you first came here?”</p>

<p>Janey, looking eagerly on, saw Northcote grow pale, nay,
grey in the fresh daylight. The colour seemed to ebb out of
him. He started very slightly, as if waking up, when she
began to speak, and then sat looking at her, growing greyer
and greyer. A moment elapsed before he made any reply.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did,” he said, with a half-groan of pain in his voice.</p>

<p>“You did! really you did! Oh!” cried Ursula, the hot
tears falling suddenly out of her eyes, while she still looked at
him, “I was hoping that it was all some horrible mistake, that
you would have laughed. I hoped you would laugh and say no.”</p>

<p>Northcote cleared his throat; they were waiting for him to
defend himself. Janey, holding herself on the leash, as it were,
keeping herself back from springing upon him like a hound.
Ursula gazed at him with great blazing reproachful eyes; and
all he could do was to give that sign of embarrassment, of
guilt, and confusion. He could not utter a word. By the
time he had got himself wound up to the point of speech,
Ursula, impatient, had taken the words out of his mouth.</p>

<p>“Reginald is my brother,” she said. “Whatever is against
him is against us all; we have never had any separate interests.
Didn't you think it strange, Mr. Northcote, to come to this
house, among us all, when you had been so unkind to him?”</p>

<p>“Miss May—”</p>

<p>He made a broken sort of outcry and motion of his head,
and then cleared his throat nervously once more.</p>

<p>“Did you think how your own brothers and sisters would
have stood up for you? that it would have been an offence to
them if anybody had come to the house who was not a friend
to you? that they would have had a right—”</p>

<p>“Miss May,” said the culprit; “all this I have felt to the
bottom of my heart; that I was here on false pretences—that
I had no right to be here. But this painful feeling was all
quenched and extinguished, and turned into gratitude by the
goodness of your father and brother. I did not even know
that you had not been told. I thought you were aware from
the beginning. You were colder than they were, and I
thought it was natural, quite natural, for it is easier to forgive
for one's self than for those one loves; and then I thought
you melted and grew kinder to me, that you saw how all my
ideas were changed, all my feelings—my mind itself; changed
by the great charity, the wonderful goodness I have found
here!”</p>

<p>“Mr. Northcote!” Ursula had been struggling to break in
all the time; but while he spoke her words dispersed, her
feelings softened, and at the end she found nothing but that
startled repetition of his name with which to answer him. No
doubt if he had given her time the eloquence would have come
back; but he was too much in earnest to be guilty of such a
mistake.</p>

<p>“What can I say about it?” cried the young man. “It
has filled me with shame and with happiness. I have been
taken in my own trap—those whom I attacked as you say—went
out of my way to attack, and abused like a fool because
I knew nothing about them—have shown me what the Bible
means. Your father and brother knew what I had done, they
met me separately, quite independent of each other, and both
of them held out their hands to me; why, except that I had
offended them, I cannot tell. A stranger, belonging to an
obscure class, I had no claim upon them except that I had
done what ought to have closed their house against me. And
you know how they have interpreted that. They have shown
me what the Bible means.”</p>

<p>The two girls sat listening, both with their heads bent towards
him, and their eyes fixed upon his face. When he
stopped, Janey got up with her work in her lap, and coming
a little nearer to Ursula, addressed her in a wondering voice.</p>

<p>“Is it <i>papa</i> he is talking of like that?” she said, under her
breath.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, fervently, turning to her. “It is your
father. He has made charity and kindness real things to me.”</p>

<p>“Poor papa!” said Ursula, whose tears were arrested in
her eyes by the same surprised sensation, half-pleasure, half-pain,
which hushed even Janey's voice. They were “struck,”
as Mrs. Hurst had said, but by such a strange mingling of
feelings that neither knew what to make of them. Northcote
did not understand what they meant; their words conveyed
a slight shock of surprise, but no distinct idea to him; and
when Janey, too much impressed to settle down again, went
away after a while musingly, carrying her work in the upper
skirt of her gown, held like a market-woman's apron by her
elbow against her side; and he found himself to have attained
in the very confusion of his intentions to what he wished, i.e.,
an interview with Ursula by herself, he was almost too much
agitated to take advantage of it. As for Ursula, she had
floated a hundred miles away from that sensation of last night
which, had no stronger feeling come in to bewilder her, would
have made his errand very plain to her mind. She had
ceased to think about him, she was thinking with a certain
tenderness, and wondering, half-awed, half-amused, self-questioning,
about her father. Was he so good as this? had he
done this Christian action? were they all perhaps doing papa
injustice? She was recalled to herself by Northcote's next
proceeding. He went to the door and closed it after Janey,
who had left it open, of course, and then he came to the back
of the chair on which stood the great basket of darning. His
voice was tremulous, his eyes liquid and shining with emotion.</p>

<p>“Will you forgive me, since they have forgiven me? and
may I ask <i>you</i> something?” he said.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"/>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<h3>AN EXTRAVAGANCE.</h3>


<p>Mr. May did not take any particular notice of what was
going on around him among the young people. Nobody could
have been more startled than he, had he been told of the purpose
with which Horace Northcote, the Dissenting minister,
had paid his early morning visit; and though he had a half-scornful,
half-amused glimmer of insight into the feelings of
his son, and saw that Clarence Copperhead was heavily veering
the same way, it did not occur to him that any crisis was approaching.
He was enjoying himself in his way, and he had
not done that for a long time. He dearly liked the better way
of living, the more liberal strain of housekeeping and expenditure;
he liked the social meetings in the evening, the talk after
dinner with the three young men, the half-fatherly flirtation
with Phœbe, which she too enjoyed much, avowedly preferring
him, with pretty coquetry, to the others. All this was very
pleasant to him; and the additional money in his pocket was
very pleasant, and when the post came in, one of these April
mornings, and brought a letter from James, enclosing a draft
for fifty pounds, his satisfaction was intense. The sight of the
money brought an itching to his fingers, a restlessness about
him generally. And yet it was not all that might have been
desired, only fifty pounds! he had been buoying himself up by
vain thoughts of how James this time, having been so long
writing, would send a larger sum, which would at once tide him
over the Tozer business, and on this account had been giving
himself no trouble about it. Never before had he been so <i>insouciant</i>,
although never before had the risk been so great. He
had suffered so much about it last time, probably, that was why
he took it so easily now; or was it because his trust in the
chapter of accidents had grown greater since he was more dependent
on it? or because of the generally expanded sense of
living in him which made anxiety uncongenial anyhow?
Whatever the cause was, this was the effect. A momentary
disappointment when he saw how little James's draft was—then
a sense of that semi-intoxication which comes upon a poor
man when a sum of money falls into his hands—gradually
invaded his soul. He tried to settle down to his writing, but
did not feel equal to the effort. It was too little for the purpose,
he said to himself, for which he wanted it; but it was
enough to do a great many pleasant things with otherwise.
For the first time he had no urgent bills to swallow it up; the
very grocer, a long-suffering tradesman who made less fuss than
the others, and about whom Ursula made less fuss, had been
pacified by a payment on account of the Copperhead money,
and thus had his mouth stopped. Barring that bill, indeed,
things were in a more comfortable state than they had been for
a long time in the May household; and putting that out of
account, James's money would have been the nearest approach
to luxury—reckoning luxury in its most simple form as money
to spend without any absolutely forestalling claim upon it—which
Mr. May had known for years. It is so seldom that
poor people have this delicious sense of a little, ever so little
surplus! and it would be hard to say how he could entertain
the feeling that it was an overplus. There was something of
the fumes of desperation perhaps, and impending fate in the
lightness of heart which seized upon him. He could not keep
still over his writing. He got up at last, and put James's
draft into his pocket-book, and got his hat to go out. It was
a fine morning, full of that exhilaration which belongs only to
the spring. He went to the bank, and paid in the money, getting
a small sum at the same time for his own immediate use;
but somehow his restlessness was scarcely satisfied by that very
legitimate piece of business, and he extended his walk into the
town, and strayed, half by chance, half by intention, to the old
furniture shop at the other end of the High Street, which was
a favourite resort of the higher classes in Carlingford, and
where periodically there was an auction, at which sometimes
great bargains were to be had. Mr. May went into this dangerous
place boldly. The sale was going on; he walked into
the midst of temptation, forgetting the prayer against it, which
no doubt he had said that morning. And as evil fate would
have it, a carved book-case, the very thing he had been sighing
for, for years, was at that moment the object of the auctioneer's
praises. It was standing against the wall, a noble piece of furniture,
in which books would show to an advantage impossible
otherwise, preserved from dust and damp by the fine old oak
and glass door. Mr. May's heart gave a little jump. Almost
everybody has wished for something unattainable, and this had
been the object of his desires for years. He gave a little start
when he saw it, and hurried forward. The bidding had actually
begun; there was no time to think and consider, if he wished
to have a chance, and it was going cheap, dead cheap. After
a minute or two of competition the blood rose to his cheeks, he
got thoroughly excited. The effect of this excitement was two-fold—not
only did it drive all thought of prudence out of his
head, but it raised by several pounds the price of the book-case,
which, had he gone about it coolly, he might have had at a
much cheaper rate. When he suddenly woke up to find himself
the owner of it, a thrill of consternation ran over him—it
was all so sudden; and it was perfectly innocent, if only he had
any money; and to be sure he had James's money, which was
not enough to do anything else—certainly not to do the thing
he wanted it for. He tried to laugh at himself for the little
thrill of alarm that ran through him; but it was too late to
recede; and he gave his cheque for the money and his directions
as to having it sent to the Parsonage, with a quake at his
heart, yet a little flourish of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Just what I have been wanting for years,” he said, as he
examined his new acquisition, and the people about looked at
him with additional respect he felt, not being used to see Mr.
May so prompt in payment, and so ready with his money.
This pleased him also. He walked home with his head a little
turned still, although there was a quake and flutter underneath.
Well! he said to himself, who could call it an extravagance? a
thing he had wanted for years—a thing which was a necessity,
not for luxury, but everyday use—a thing which was not dear,
and which was very handsome and substantial, and <i>really good</i>;
how could any one say it was extravagant? Ursula might
stare with her big eyes, but she was only a silly little girl, and
women always were silly about expenses, alarmed by a big bold
handsome purchase, though there was nobody better at the art
of frittering away money in pretty nothings. When he got
home, he began at once nervously to clear the space where it
should stand. What an improvement it would be! and his
books were getting spoiled daily in those unsightly, open
shelves, entirely spoiled. It was exciting to anticipate its
arrival, and the admiration and commotion in the house. He
called in Betsy and gave her orders about it; how, if it came
when he was absent, it was to be put in that particular place,
no other.</p>

<p>“And mind that great care is taken, for it is valuable, and a
beautiful piece of furniture,” he said.</p>

<p>“La, sir!” said Betsy, who was thunderstruck, though she
knew it was not “her place” to show any feeling. He did not
think it was necessary to appeal to Ursula on the same subject,
but was rather glad to get out again, feeling the restlessness
which had not been dissipated, but rather the reverse. He
went and saw one or two poor people, to whom he was much
more tolerant and kind than his wont, for in general Mr. May
was not attracted towards the poor; and he gave them a shilling
or two of the money he had drawn at the bank that morning—though
somehow it had acquired a certain value in his eyes, and
it was with a grudge that he took it out of his pocket. I must
not spend this, he said to himself; but gave the shillings as a
kind of tithe or propitiatory offering to Providence, that things
might go well with him. Why should not things go well with
him? He was not a bad man, he wronged nobody. He had
done nothing to-day that a saint might not have done; he
wanted the book-case, and he had the money, a sum not big
enough for any more important purpose; but which was far
better disposed of so than frittered away in nothings, as no
doubt it would have otherwise been. By the afternoon, when
the book-case arrived, he had convinced himself that it was
not only quite reasonable, but a most lucky chance, a thing he
could scarcely have hoped for, the opportunity and the money
both coming in such exact accord with each other. When he
returned from his walk the girls were looking at it, Ursula
somewhat scared, Janey in open raptures.</p>

<p>“It is very nice indeed, papa,” said the elder girl; “but it
must have cost a deal of money.”</p>

<p>“Be thankful that you haven't got to pay for it,” he said,
brusquely. He was not disposed to stand criticism. How it
filled up his bare room, and made it, Mr. May thought, all at
once into a library, though the old writing-table and shabby
chairs looked rather worse perhaps than before, and suggested
renewal in the most urgent way. To make it all of a piece, to
put a soft Turkey carpet instead of the drugget, how pleasant it
would be!—not extravagant, only a natural inclination towards
the seemly, and a desire to have things around him becoming
his position. No doubt such things were things which he
ought to have in his position; a gentleman and a scholar, how
humiliating it was that nothing but the barest elements of
comfort should be within his reach. This was not how life
ought to be; a poor creature like Clarence Copperhead, without
birth, or breeding, or brains, or anything but money, was able
to gratify every wish, while he—his senior, his superior! Instead
of blaming himself, therefore, for his self-indulgence,
Mr. May sympathized with himself, which is a much less safe
thing to do; and accordingly, it soon began to appear to him
that his self-denial all this time in not giving himself what he
wanted had been extreme, and that what he had now done,
in conceding himself so harmless a gratification, was what he
ought to have done years ago. It was his own money sent to him
by his dutiful son without conditions; and who had any right
to interfere?</p>

<p>When he was at dinner, Betsy came behind his chair under
pretence of serving him; Betsy, whose place was in the kitchen,
who had no right to show in the dining-room at all, and whose confused
toilette had caught Ursula's eye and filled her with horror.</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” she said, breathing hot on Mr. May's ear, till
he shrank with sensitive horror. “Cotsdean's in the kitchen.
He says as how he must see you; and I can't get him away.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Cotsdean? tell him if he has anything to say to me, to
write it down.”</p>

<p>“Which he's done, sir,” said Betsy, producing a little bit of
paper rolled tightly together, “but I wasn't to give it till I'd
asked you to see him. Oh, please see him, sir, like a dear good
gentleman. He looks like a man as is going off his head.”</p>

<p>“He is a fool,” said Mr. May, taking the paper, but setting
his teeth as he did so. Evidently he must get rid of this
fellow—already beginning to trouble him, as if he was not the
best person to know when and how far he could go.</p>

<p>“Tell him I'll attend to it, he need not trouble himself,” he
said, and put the paper into his pocket, and went on with his
dinner. Cotsdean, indeed! surely there had been enough of
him. What were his trumpery losses in comparison with what
his principal would lose, and how dare that fellow turn up thus
and press him continually for his own poor selfish safety? This
was not how Mr. May had felt three months before; but
everything changes, and he felt that he had a right to be
angry at this selfish solicitude. Surely it was of as much consequence
to him at least as to Cotsdean. The man was a fussy
disagreeable fool, and nothing more.</p>

<p>And as it happened they sat late that night at dinner, without
any particular reason, because of some discussion into which
Clarence and Reginald fell, so that it was late before Mr. May
got back to his room, where his books were lying in a heap
waiting their transportation. They seemed to appeal to him
also, and ask him reproachfully how they had got there, and he
went to work arranging them all with all the enthusiasm
natural to a lover of books. He was a book-lover, a man full of
fine tastes and cultured elegant ways of thinking. If he had
been extravagant (which he was not) it would have been in the
most innocent, nay delightful and laudable way. To attach any
notion of criminality, any suspicion of wrong-doing to such a
virtuous indulgence, how unjust it would be! There was no
company upstairs that evening. Copperhead had strolled out
with Reginald to smoke his cigar, much against the will of the
latter, and was boring him all the way to the College with
accounts of his own lavish expenditure, and how much he had
given for this and that; his cameos, his diamond studs, the magnificent
dressing-case which was the wonder of the Parsonage.
“Hang it all, what is the good of having money if you don't
spend it?” said Clarence, and Reginald, who had not much money
to spend, felt as near hating him as it was in his nature to do.
Thus Mr. May was released from duty in the drawing-room,
where Ursula, palpitating with many thoughts which were
altogether new to her, sat doing her darning, and eluding as
well as she could Janey's questions. Janey was determinedly
conversational that night. She drove Ursula nearly out of her
senses, and kept Johnnie—who had crept into the drawing-room
in high delight at finding it for once free to him—from
learning his lessons.</p>

<p>“Oh, how nice it is to be by ourselves,” said Janey, “instead
of all those new people. I don't mind Phœbe; but strange
men in the house, what a nuisance they are, always getting in
one's way—don't you think so, Ursula?”</p>

<p>Ursula made no reply, and after awhile even Janey sank into
silence, and the drawing-room, usually so gay, got a cold and
deserted look. The new life which had come in had left its
mark, and to go back to what had once been so pleasant in the
past was no longer possible. Johnnie and Janey might like it,
having regained their former places, but to Ursula the solitude
was horrible. She asked herself, with a great blush and quiver,
what she would do if that temporary filling up of new interests
and relationships was to fall away, as was likely, and leave her
to the old life unbroken, to Janey's childish society and questions,
and papa's imperious and unmodified sway. She grew
pale and chill at the very thought.</p>

<p>But Mr. May, as we have said, was off duty. He forgot all
about Cotsdean and the note in his pocket, and set to work
with the most boyish simplicity of delight to arrange his books
in his new shelves. How well they looked! never before had
their setting done them justice. There were books in gorgeous
bindings, college prizes which had never shown at all, and
which now gleamed out in crimson and gold from behind the
glass, and made their owner's heart beat with pleasure. Alas!
to think how much innocent pleasure is denied us by the want
of that small sum of money! and worse still, how an innocent
pleasure becomes the reverse of innocent when it is purchased
by the appropriation of something which should have been employed
elsewhere. Perhaps, however, the sense of guilt which
he kept under, added zest in Mr. May's mind to the pleasure
of his acquisition; he was snatching a fearful joy, Heaven
knows how soon the penalty might overwhelm him. In the
mean time he was determined to take the good of it, and enjoy
what he had gained.</p>

<p>When the books were all in he sat down at his table and
surveyed it, rubbing his dusty hands. How much that is
childish, how much that is fresh, and youthful, and innocent
must be in the mind of a man (you would say) who could be
thus excited about a book-case! and yet this was not the kind
of man whom you would call unsophisticated and youthful. It
was probably the state of suppressed excitement in which he
was, the unreality of his position, that helped him to that sense
of elation as much as anything else; for emotion is a Proteus
ready to take any form, and pain itself sometimes finds vent in
the quick blazing up of fictitious delight, as much as in the
moanings that seem more accordant with its own nature. He
put his hand into his pocket for his pencil to make a note of
the contents of the new shelves, and then he found Cotsdean's
note, which he had not forgotten, but which he had felt no
desire to remember. When he felt it between his fingers his
countenance fell a little; but he took it out and read it with
the smile still upon his face. It was a dirty little roll of paper,
scribbled in pencil.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Rev. Sir,</p>

<p>“I hope as you are not forgetting the 15th. Pleas excuse
anxiety and bad writing, i am a poor nervous man I no, a word
of answer just to say as it is all right will much oblidge.</p>

<div class="xhtml_center">
“Rev. Sir,<br/>
“Your humble servant,</div>
<p style="text-align: right;">“<span class="smcap">T. Cotsdean.</span>”</p></div>

<p>Betsy knocked at the door as he read this, with a request for
an answer to Mr. Cotsdean's note. “Little Bobby, sir, is
waiting for it in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Give Bobby some supper,” said Mr. May, “tell him to tell
his father it's all right, and I shan't forget. You understand?
He is a troublesome little fool; but it's all right, and I shan't
forget, and give the child some supper, Betsy. He ought not
to be out so late.”</p>

<p>“He is a delicate little thing, sir, thankye, sir,” said Betsy,
half-frightened by her master's amiability; and he smiled and
repeated,</p>

<p>“Tell him it's all right.”</p>

<p>Was it all right, the 15th? Cotsdean must have made a
mistake. Mr. May's countenance paled, and the laugh went
off; he opened a drawer in his writing-table and took out a
book, and anxiously consulted an entry in it. It was the 18th
certainly, as clear as possible. Something had been written on
the opposite page, and had blotted slightly the one on which
these entries were written; but there it stood, the 18th April.
Mr. May prided himself on making no mistakes in business.
He closed the book again with a look of relief, the smile coming
back once more to his face. The 18th, it was three days additional,
and in the time there was no doubt that he would
find out what was the right thing to do.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXV"/>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>
<h3>THE MILLIONNAIRE.</h3>


<p>When Mr. May woke next morning, it was not the book-case
he thought of, but that date which had been the last thing in
his mind on the previous night. Not the 15th,—the 18th.
Certainly he was right, and Cotsdean was wrong. Cotsdean
was a puzzle-headed being, making his calculations by the rule
of thumb; but he had put down the date, and there could be
no possible mistake about it. He got up disposed to smile at
the poor man's ignorance and fussy restlessness of mind.
“I have never left him in the lurch, he may trust to me surely
in the future,” Mr. May said to himself, and smiled with a kind
of condescending pity for his poor agent's timidity; after all,
perhaps, as Cotsdean had so little profit by it, it was not wonderful
that he should be uneasy. After this, it might be well if
they did anything further of the sort, to divide the money, so
that Cotsdean too might feel that he had got something for the
risk he ran; but then, to be sure, if he had not the money he
had no trouble, except by his own foolish anxiety, for the payment,
and always a five-pound note or two for his pains. But
Mr. May said to himself that he would do no more in this way
after the present bill was disposed of; no, he would make a
stand, he would insist upon living within his income. He
would not allow himself to be subject to these perpetual agitations
any more. It would require an effort, but after the effort
was made all would be easy. So he said to himself; and it
was the 18th, not the 15th, three days more to make his arrangements
in. It had come to be the 12th now, and up to
this moment he had done nothing, having that vague faith in
the Indian mail which had been realized, and yet had not been
realized. But still he had nearly a week before him, which
was enough certainly. Anything that he could do in six
months, he said to himself, he could easily do in six days—the
mere time was nothing; and he smiled as he dressed himself
leisurely, thinking it all over. Somehow everything looked
perfectly easy to him this time; last time he had been plunged
into tragic despair; now, and he did not know why, he took
it quite easily; he seemed to fear nothing. There were various
ways of getting the money as natural as the daylight, and in
the mean time why should he make himself unhappy? As soon
as he was ready he went to his room and had another look at
the book-case which, with his best books in it, all in order and
ranged in unbroken lines, looked everything a book-case ought
to look. It made him feel more of a man somehow, more like
the gentleman and scholar he had meant to be when he started
in life; he had not intended then to be a poor district incumbent
all his life, with a family of eight children. His book-case somehow
transported him back to the days when he had thought
of better things for himself, and when life had held an ideal for
him. Perhaps at the best of times it had never been a very
high ideal; but when a man is over fifty and has given up doing
anything but struggle through each day as it comes, and get
out of his work as best he may, doing what he must, leaving
undone what he can, any ideal almost seems something higher
than himself; but the recollection of what he had meant to be,
came back to him strongly when he looked at his carved oak.
It had not been carried out; but still he felt rehabilitated and
better in his own opinion as he stood beside this costly purchase
he had made, and felt that it changed his room and all his
surroundings. It might have been almost wicked to run into
such an extravagance, but yet it did him good.</p>

<p>“My people came down to the Hall last night,” Clarence
Copperhead said to him at breakfast, “and the Governor is
coming over along with Sir Robert. He'd like to see you, I
am sure, and I suppose they'll be going in for sight-seeing, and
that sort of thing. He is a dab at sight-seeing, is the Governor.
I can't think how he can stand it for my part.”</p>

<p>“Then you must remember that I put myself at his orders
for the day,” said Mr. May graciously. “Sir Robert is not a
bad guide, but I am a better, though it sounds modest to say
it; and, Ursula, of course Mr. Copperhead will take luncheon
with us.”</p>

<p>“Don't think of that,” said Clarence, “he's queer and likes
his own way. Just as likely as not he'll think he ought to
support the hotels of the place where he is—sort of local production,
you know. I think it's nonsense, but that is how it is—that's
the man.”</p>

<p>“We shall look for him all the same,” said Mr. May, with a
nod at Ursula; and a sudden project sprang up in his mind,
wild as projects so often are. This father whom his fancy,
working upon what Clarence said, immediately invested with
all the prodigal liberality of a typical rich man; this stranger
to whom a hundred pounds was less then a penny was to himself,
would give him the money he wanted. What so easy?
He drew a long breath, and though he had not been aware that
he was anxious, he was suddenly conscious of a sense of relief.
Yes, to be sure, what so simple, what so likely? he would explain
his monetary necessities lightly and with grace, and Mr.
Copperhead would supply them. He was in the mildest state
of desperation, the painless stage, as may be seen, when this
strange idea entered into his head. He hugged it, though he
was a man of the world and might have known better, and it
produced a kind of elation which would have been a very strange
spectacle to any looker-on who knew what it meant. The
thing seemed done when he next thought of it ten minutes
later, settled as if it had been so for years. Mr. Copperhead
would make it all right for him, and after that he would undertake
such risks no more.</p>

<p>Mr. Copperhead, however, did not come for two days, though
Ursula spent all the morning and a great deal of trouble in
arranging a luncheon for him; but on the second morning he
came, driven by Sir Robert, who had changed horses on the
road, and who was in a somewhat irritated and excited condition,
very glad to get rid of his visitor.</p>

<p>“I hope you don't mind having your toes trodden on, May,”
he said, privately; “that fellow is never happy but when he's
insulting some one.” And indeed Mr. Copperhead began this
favourite pastime at once by making very big eyes at the sight
of Ursula. “A-ha!” he said, rubbing his hands, and elevating
his eyebrows; and he gave a meaning laugh as he shook
hands with her, and declared that he did not expect to find
young ladies here. “I haven't a great deal of education myself,
and I never knew it could be carried on so pleasantly,” he said.
“You're a lucky young dog, Clar, that's what you are;” and
the son laughed with the father at this excellent joke, though
the rest of the company looked on with great gravity. Ursula,
for her part, turned with wondering eyes from the new-comer
to her old friend, Sir Robert.</p>

<p>“What does he mean?” she asked, with an appealing look.</p>

<p>“He is the greatest brute I know,” said poor Sir Robert,
under his breath; and he went off suddenly on the plea of
business, leaving his unpleasant visitor in Mr. May's hands,
who undertook the charge not unwillingly, being possessed by
his own plan. Mr. Copperhead went all over Carlingford. He
inspected the town-hall, the infirmary, and the church, with
the business-like air of a man who was doing his duty.</p>

<p>“Poor little place, but well enough for the country,” he said.
“A country-town's a mistake in my opinion. If I had it in
my power I'd raze them all to the ground, and have one London
and the rest green fields. That's your sort, Mr. May.
Now you don't produce anything here, what's the good of
you? All unproductive communities, sir, ought to be swept
off the face of the earth. I'd let Manchester and those sort of
places go on till they burst; but a bit of a little piggery like
this, where there's nothing doing, no trade, no productions of
any kind.”</p>

<p>“We like it all the same,” said Mr. May; “we small sort of
people who have no enterprise like you—”</p>

<p>“I dare say you like it! To be sure, you can moon about
here as much as you please, and make believe to do something,
and there's nobody to contradict you. In a great centre of
industry you couldn't live like that; you must work or you'll
get pushed aside altogether; unless, of course, you're a
millionnaire to start with,” Mr. Copperhead added, with a noisy
laugh.</p>

<p>“Which I am not certainly—very much the reverse—in
short, a poor man with a large family, which I suppose is a
thing about as objectionable in a centre of industry as anything
can be.”</p>

<p>“The large family ain't objectionable if you make 'em work,”
said Mr. Copperhead; “it all depends on that. There's always
objections, you know,” he said, with a jocular grin, “to pretty
girls like that daughter of yours put straight in a young fellow's
way. You won't mind my saying it? They neither work
themselves nor let others work—that sort. I think we could
get on with a deal fewer women, I must allow. There's where
Providence is in a mistake. We don't want 'em in England;
it's a waste of raw material. They're bad for the men, and they
ain't much good for themselves, that I can see.”</p>

<p>“You are a little hard upon the ladies, Mr. Copperhead.”</p>

<p>“Not I—we can't do without 'em of course, and the surplus
we ought to export as we export other surpluses; but I object
to them in a young man's way, not meaning anything unpleasant
to you. And perhaps if I had been put up to it
sooner—but let's hope there's no mischief done. What is this
now? some of your antiquities, I suppose. Oh yes, let's have
a look at it; but I confess it's the present age I like best.”</p>

<p>“This is the College,” cried Mr. May, swallowing certain
sensations which impaired his sense of friendliness; “but not
an educational college, a foundation for old men—decayed
citizens, as they are called—founded in the fifteenth century.
My son is the chaplain, and will be very glad to show it you.
There are twelve old men here at present, very comfortably
looked after, thanks to the liberal arrangements of the founder.
They attend chapel twice a day, where Reginald officiates. It
is very agreeable to me to have him settled so near me.”</p>

<p>“Cunning I call it,” said Mr. Copperhead, with his hoarse
laugh; “does you credit; a capital snug nest—nothing to do—and
pay—pay good now? those old fellows generally managed
that; as it was priests that had the doing of it, of course they
did well for their own kind. Good Lord, what a waste of good
money all this is!” he continued, as they went into the
quadrangle, and saw the little park beyond with its few fine
trees; “half-a-dozen nice villas might be built on this site, and
it's just the sort of place I should fancy where villas would
pay. Why don't the Corporation lay hands on it? And your
son lives here? Too dull for me; I like a little movement
going on, but I dare say he likes it; and with how much a
year?”</p>

<p>“Two hundred and fifty; and some advantages beside—”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” said Mr. Copperhead, “now how many curates
could you get for that two and a-half? I've got a great respect
for you, Mr. May; you know what's what. That shows sense,
that does. How do you do, sir? fine old place you've got
here—capital snug appointment. I've just been saying to
your father I admire his sense, looking out for you a nice fat
easy appointment like this.”</p>

<p>Reginald turned from red to white, and then to portentous
blackness. The subject was of all others the one least likely
to please him.</p>

<p>“It is not very fat,” he said, with a look of offence, quite
undeserved by the chief sufferer, towards his father, “nor very
easy. But come in. It is rather an interesting old place. I
suppose you would like to see the Chapel, and the old captain's
rooms; they are very fine in their way.”</p>

<p>“Thank you; we've been seeing a deal already, and I feel
tired. I think I'll—let you off the chapel. Hallo! here's
another old friend—Northcote, by George! and what are <i>you</i>
doing here I should like to know, a blazing young screamer of
the Liberation Society, in a high and dry parson's rooms?
This is as good as a play.”</p>

<p>“I suppose one is not required to stay at exactly the same
point of opinion all one's life,” said Northcote, with a half-smile.</p>

<p>“By George! but you are though, when you're a public
man; especially when you're on a crusade. Haven't I heard
you call it a crusade? I can tell you that changing your opinion
is just the very last thing the public will permit you to do. But
I shan't tell for my part—make yourself easy. Clarence, don't
you let it out; your mother, fortunately, is out of the way.
The world shall never know through me that young Northcote,
the anti-state Churchman, was discovered hob-nobbing with a
snug chaplain in a sinecure appointment. Ha, ha! had you there.”</p>

<p>“To do Northcote justice,” said Mr. May; “he began life in
Carlingford by pointing out this fact to the neighbourhood;
that it was a sinecure, and that my son and I—”</p>

<p>“Would it not be more to the point to inspect the chapel?”
said Reginald, who had been standing by impatiently playing
with a big key; upon which Mr. Copperhead laughed more
loudly than before.</p>

<p>“We'll not trouble the chapel,” he said, “railway stations
are more in my way; you are all a great deal finer than I am,
and know a deal more, I suppose; but my roughness has
served its purpose on the whole, better perhaps for some things—yes,
for some things, Clar, and you may thank your stars, old
boy. If you had been a parson's son, by George! there would
have been no fat appointment waiting for you.”</p>

<p>“After all, my son's appointment is not so very fat,” said
Mr. May, forcing a laugh. “It is not so much as many a boy
at school gets from his father.”</p>

<p>“Ah, you mean my boy at school! he's an extravagant dog.
His mother and he, sir, are made of different clay from me;
they are porcelain and I am delft. They want fine velvet cupboards
to stand themselves in, while I'm for the kitchen
dresser. That's the difference. But I can afford it, thank
Heaven. I tell Clarence that he may thank his stars that I can
afford it, and that he isn't born a poor man's son. He has
been plucked at Oxford, you know,” he said, with a big laugh,
thrusting forth his chest as Clarence thrust forth his shirt-front,
with an apparent complacency over the very plucking.
My son can afford to be plucked, he seemed to say. He got up
as he spoke, and approaching the fireplace turned his back to
it, and gathered up his coat-tails under his arm. He was no
taller than Mr. May, and very little taller than Reginald; but
they both shrank into insignificance beside the big self-assertive
figure. He looked about the room as if he was thinking
of “buying up” the whole contents of it, and thought
very little of them. A glance of contempt, a shrug more implied
than actual, testified his low opinion of everything around.
When he withdrew his eyes from the furniture he shook out
his leg, as Clarence had done his, and gave a pull to his
trousers that they might sit properly. He had the word
“Rich” painted in big letters all over him, and he seemed to
feel it his vocation to show this sense of superiority. Clarence
by his side, the living copy of the great man's appearance and
manners, strutted and put himself forward like his father, as a
big calf might place itself beside the parent cow. Mr. Copperhead
did not look upon his offspring, however, with the cow's
motherly complacency. He laughed at him openly, with
cynical amusement. He was clever in his way, and Clarence
was stupid; and besides he was the proprietor, and Clarence,
for all he was porcelain, was his goods and chattels. When he
looked at him, a wicked leer of derision awoke in his eye.</p>

<p>“Yes, my boy,” he said, “thank your stars; you would not
make much of it if you were a poor man. You're an ornament
that costs dear; but I can afford you. So, Northcote, you're
changing your opinions—going over to the Church, eh? Extremes
meet, they say; I shouldn't have thought it—”</p>

<p>“I am doing nothing of the kind,” said Northcote stoutly.
He was not in a mood to be taken to task by this Mammon of
unrighteousness, and indeed had at all times been a great deal
too independent and unwilling to submit to leading members
of the connection. Mr. Copperhead, however, showed no resentment.
Northcote too, like Clarence, had a father before
him, and stood on quite a different footing from the ordinary
young pastor, whose business it was to be humble and accept all
that his betters might portion out.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “you can afford to please yourself, and
that's always something. By the way, isn't it time to have
something to eat? If there is a good hotel near—”</p>

<p>“Luncheon will be waiting at my house,” said Mr. May, who
was still doing his best to please the man upon whom he had
built such wild hopes, “and Ursula will be waiting.”</p>

<p>“Ah, ah, the young lady! so she will. I wouldn't miss that
for something; but I don't like putting you to so much expense.
My son here has an excellent appetite, as you must have found
out by this time, and for my part so have I. I think it a
thousand pities to put you to this trouble—and expense.”</p>

<p>“Pray don't think of that,” said Mr. May with courtesy,
which belied his feelings, for he would have liked nothing so
well as to have knocked down his complacent patron. He led the
way out, almost with eagerness, feeling Mr. Copperhead to be less
offensive out of doors than within four walls. Was this the
sort of man to be appealed to for help as he had thought?
Probably his very arrogance would make him more disposed
towards liberality. Probably it would flatter his sense of consequence,
to have such a request made to him. Mr. May was
very much at sea, letting I dare not wait upon I would;
afraid to speak lest he should shut this door of help by so doing,
and afraid to lose the chance of any succour by not speaking.
He tried hard, in spite of all his difficulties, to be smooth and
agreeable to a man who had so much in his power; but it was
harder work than he could have thought.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXVI"/>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<h3>FATHER AND SON.</h3>


<p>Ursula had prepared a very careful luncheon for the
stranger. She thought him disagreeable, but she had not
looked at him much, for, indeed, Ursula's mind was much unsettled.
Horace Northcote had spoken to her that morning,
after Mrs. Hurst's visit and her retaliation upon him, as no man
yet had ever spoken to her before. He had told her a long story,
though it was briefly done, and could have been expressed in
three words. He was not of her species of humanity; his ways
of thinking, his prejudices, his traditions, were all different from
hers, and yet that had happened to him which happens all over
the world in every kind of circumstances—without knowing
how it was, he had got to love her. Yes, he knew very well
how it was, or rather, he knew when it was, which is all that is
to be expected from a lover. It was on the evening of the
<i>entrées</i>, the first dinner-party, and he had gone on ever since,
deeper and deeper, hearing her say many things which he did
not agree in, and tracing her life through a score of little habits
which were not congenial to his, yet loving her more and more
for all that was new to him, and even for the things which were
uncongenial. He had told her all this, and Ursula had listened
with a kind of awe, wondering at the ardour in the young
man's eyes, and the warmth with which he spoke; wondering
and trembling a little. She had guessed what he meant the
night before, as has been said, and this had touched her
with a little thrill of awakened feeling; but the innocent girl
knew no more about passion than a child, and when she saw it,
glowing and ardent, appealing to her, she was half-alarmed,
half-overawed by the strange sight. What answer could she
make to him? She did not know what to say. To reject
him altogether was not in Ursula's heart; but she could not
respond to that strange, new, overwhelming sentiment, which
put a light in his eyes which she dared not meet; which dazzled
her when she ventured a glance at him. “Was he to go away?”
he asked, his voice, too, sounding musical and full of touching
chords. Ursula could not tell him to go away either. What
she did say to him, she never quite knew; but at least, whatever
it was, it left him hopeful, if unsatisfied.</p>

<p>And since that time her mind had been in a strange confusion,
a confusion strange but sweet. Gratified vanity is not a pretty
title to give to any feeling, and yet that mixture of gratification
and gratitude, and penetrating pleasure in the fact of being
elevated from an often-scolded and imperfect child to an admired
and worshipped woman is, perhaps, of all the sensations
that feminine youth is conscious of, the most poignant in its
sweetness. It went through her whole life; sometimes it made
her laugh when she was all alone, and there was nothing of a
laughter-producing nature in her way; and sometimes it made
her cry, both the crying and the laughter being one. It was
strange, very strange, and yet sweet. Under the influence of
this, and of the secret homage which Northcote paid her whenever
they met; and which she now understood as she had never
understood it before, the girl's whole nature expanded, though
she did not know. She was becoming sweet to the children, to
puzzled Janey, to every one around her. Her little petulances
were all subdued. She was more sympathetic than she had
ever been before. And yet she was not in love with her lover.
It was only that the sunshine of young life had caught her, that
the highest gratification of youth had fallen to her share unawares.
All this might have been, and yet some one else come
in to secure Ursula's real love; but in the mean time she was all
the happier, all the better for the love which she did not return.</p>

<p>This is a digression from our immediate subject, which was
the luncheon prepared for Mr. Copperhead. Ursula sent up
an urgent message for Phœbe, who came to her in her prettiest
morning dress, very carefully arranged, but with a line of care
upon her brow.</p>

<p>“I will come if you wish it, dear,” she said; “but I don't
want to meet Mr. Copperhead. I don't like him.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I like him,” cried Ursula. “He said something
disagreeable the little moment he was here. Oh, I don't remember
what it was, but something. Please stay. What am
I to do with them all by myself? If you will help me, I may
get through.”</p>

<p>Phœbe kissed her with a tremulous kiss; perhaps she was
not unwilling to see with her own eyes what the father of
Clarence meant, and what brought him here. She sat down
at the window, and was the first to see them coming along the
street.</p>

<p>“What a gentleman your father looks beside them,” cried
Phœbe; “both of them, father and son; though Clarence,
after all, is a great deal better than his father, less like a
British snob.”</p>

<p>Ursula came and stood by her, looking out.</p>

<p>“I don't think he is much better than his father,” she said.</p>

<p>Phœbe took her hand suddenly and wrung it, then dropped
it as if it had hurt her. What did it all mean? Ursula,
though rays of enlightenment had come to her, was still perplexed,
and did not understand.</p>

<p>Mr. Copperhead did not see her till he went to luncheon,
when Phœbe appeared with little Amy May looking like a
visitor, newly arrived. She had run upstairs after that first
sight of him from the window, declaring herself unable to be
civil to him except at table. The great man's face almost grew
pale at the sight of her. He looked at Ursula, and then at
Clarence, and laughed.</p>

<p>“'Wheresoever the carcase is the eagles are gathered together,'”
he said. “That's Scripture, ain't it, Miss Ursula?
I am not good at giving chapter and verse.”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” asked Ursula.</p>

<p>She was quite indifferent to Mr. Copperhead, and perfectly
unconscious of his observation. As for Phœbe, on the contrary,
she was slightly agitated, her placid surface ruffled a
little, and she looked her best in her agitation. Mr. Copperhead
looked straight at her across the table, and laughed in his
insolent way.</p>

<p>“So you are here too, Miss Phœbe!” he said. “I might
think myself in the Crescent if I didn't know better. I met
young Northcote just now, and now you. What may you be
doing here, might one ask? It is what you call a curious coincidence,
ain't it, Clarence and you both here?”</p>

<p>“I said so when Mr. Clarence came,” said Phœbe. “<i>I</i>
came to take care of my grandmother, who is ill; and it was a
very lucky thing for me that I had met Miss May at your ball,
Mr. Copperhead.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, wasn't it!” said Clarence, roused to some dull
sense of what was going on. “We owe all the fun we have
had here to that, so we do. Odd, when one thinks of it; and
thought so little of it then, didn't we? It's a very queer
world.”</p>

<p>“So you've been having fun here?” said his father. “I
thought you came here to work; that's how we old fellows get
taken in. Work! with young ladies dangling about, and putting
things into your head! I ought to have known better,
don't you think so, Miss Ursula? <i>You</i> could have taught me
a thing or two.”</p>

<p>“I?” said Ursula, startled. “I don't know what I could
teach any one. I think Mr. Clarence Copperhead has kept to
his hours very steadily. Papa is rather severe; he never would
take any excuse from any of us when we were working with
him.”</p>

<p>“He is not so severe now, I'll be bound,” said Mr. Copperhead.
“Lets you have your fun a little, as Clarence tells me;
don't you, May? Girls will be girls, and boys, boys, whatever
we do; and I am sure, Miss Phœbe, you have been very
entertaining, as you always were.”</p>

<p>“I have done my best,” said Phœbe, looking him in the face.
“I should have had a dull life but for the Parsonage, and I
have tried to be grateful. I have accompanied your son on the
violin a great many evenings, and I hope our friends have liked
it. Mr. Clarence is a promising player, though I should like
him to trust less to his ear; but we always pulled through.”</p>

<p>“Thanks to you,” said Clarence, in the middle of his cutlet</p>

<p>He did not quite see why she should flourish this music in
his father's face; but still he was loyal in a dull fashion, and he
was obstinate, and did not mean to be “sat upon,” to use his
own words. As for Phœbe, her quick mind caught at once the
best line of policy. She determined to deliver Ursula, and she
determined at the same time to let her future father-in-law (if he
was to be her father-in-law) see what sort of a person he had
to deal with. As soon as she made up her mind, her agitation
disappeared. It was only the uncertainty that had cowed her;
now she saw what to do.</p>

<p>“So!” said Mr. Copperhead, “musical evenings! I hope
you have not turned poor Clar's head among you, young ladies.
It's not a very strong head; and two is more than a match for
one. I dare say he has had no chance between you.”</p>

<p>“Make yourself quite easy,” said Phœbe, with her sweetest
smile; “he was only one of a party. Mr. Reginald May and
Mr. Northcote are both very pleasant companions. Your son
is bored sometimes, but the rest of us are never bored. You
see, he has been accustomed to more brilliant society; but as
for us, we have no particular pretensions. We have been very
happy. And if there has been two to one, it has been the
other way.”</p>

<p>“I think I must let your people know of your gaieties, Miss
Phœbe. If your mother sent you here, I don't doubt it
was for a purpose, eh? She knows what she's about, and she
won't like it if she knows you are fritting away your chances
and your attentions. She has an eye for business, has Mrs.
Beecham,” said the leading member, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“You cannot tell mamma more about me than she knows
already,” said Phœbe, with rising colour.</p>

<p>And by this time every one else at table was uncomfortable.
Even Clarence, who had a dull appreciation of his father's jokes
when they were not levelled at himself, and who was by no
means indisposed to believe that “girls,” generally, were “after
him,” and that even in this particular case Phœbe herself might
have come to Carlingford on purpose to complete his conquest,
even Clarence was moved.</p>

<p>“I don't know what you mean by brilliant society,” he said.
“I know I'm the dull one among you clever people. I don't
say much, but I know it all the same; and it's awfully good of
you to pull me through all that music. I don't begrudge you
your laugh after. Is my mother coming over, sir, to see the
place?”</p>

<p>“To see what? There is not much in the place,” said Mr.
Copperhead. “You're coming back with me, my boy. I hope
it won't inconvenience you, May. I've other views for him.
Circumstances alter cases, you know. I've been turning it
over in my head, and I think I can see my way to another
arrangement.”</p>

<p>“That, of course, is entirely in your own hands,” said Mr.
May, with a cheerfulness he did not feel. His heart sank, but
every rule of good society made it incumbent upon him to
show no failure at such a moment. “Copperhead, see that
your father has some wine. Well, I suppose our poor little
Carlingford is not much of a place; no trade, no movement, no
manufactures—”</p>

<p>“The sort of place that should be cleared off the face of the
earth,” said the millionnaire; “meaning no offence, of course.
That's my opinion in respect to country towns. What's the
good of them? Nests of gossip, places where people waste
their time, and don't even amuse themselves. Give me green
fields and London, that is my sort. I don't care if there was
not another blessed brick in the country. There is always
something that will grow in a field, corn or fat beasts—not
that we couldn't get all that cheaper from over the water if it
was managed as it ought to be. But a place like this, what's
the good of it? Almshouses and chaplains, and that kind of
rubbish, and old women; there's old women by the score.”</p>

<p>“They must be somewhere, I suppose,” said Mr. May.
“We cannot kill them off, if they are inoffensive, and keep the
laws. So that, after all, a country town is of use.”</p>

<p>“Kill 'em off—no; it's against what you benevolent humbugs
call the spirit of the time, and Christianity, and all that;
but there's such a thing as carrying Christianity too far; that's
my opinion. There's your almshouses now. What's the principle
of them? I call it encouraging those old beggars to
live,” said Mr. Copperhead; “giving them permission to burden
the community as long as they can manage it; a dead
mistake, depend upon it, the greatest mistake in the world.”</p>

<p>“I think there is a great deal to be said in favour of
Euthanasia,” said Phœbe, quietly stepping into the conversation;
“but then it would have to be with the consent of the
victims. When any one found himself useless, unnecessary to
the world, or unhappy in it—”</p>

<p>“Humbug and nonsense,” said Mr. Copperhead. “A likely
thing for anybody to do. No, it is not a question for law-making.
Let 'em die out naturally, that's my opinion. Don't
do anything to hurry 'em—that is, I don't see my way to it;
but let 'em go quiet, and don't bring 'em cordials and feather-beds,
and all that middyeval nonsense, to keep 'em going as
long as possible. It's wicked, that's what it is.”</p>

<p>“At all events,” said Mr. May, who, poor man, was bent on
pleasing, “it is refreshing to hear opinions so bold and original.
Something new is always a blessing. I cannot say I agree
with you—”</p>

<p>“No parson would be bold enough for that. Christianity's
been a capital thing for the world,” said Mr. Copperhead, “I
don't say a word against it; but in these go-ahead days, sir,
we've had enough of it, that's to say when it's carried too far.
All this fuss about the poor, all the row about dragging up a
lot of poor little beggars to live that had far better die, and
your almshouses to keep the old ones going, past all nature!
Shovel the mould over them, that's the thing for the world;
let 'em die when they ought to die; and let them live who can
live—that's my way of thinking—and what's more, I'm right.”</p>

<p>“What a fine thing for you, Mr. Clarence,” cried Phœbe,
“who are going into Parliament! to take up your father's
idea and work it out. What a speech you could make on the
subject! I saw a hospital once in Paris that would make such
a wonderful illustration. I'll tell you about it if you like.
Poor old wretched people whose life was nothing but wretchedness
kept going, kept living for years and years—why, no one
could tell; for I am sure it would have been better, far better
for them to die and be done with it. What a speech you
might make when you bring a bill into Parliament to abolish
almshouses and all sorts of charities!” she added with a
laugh, turning from Clarence, at whom she had been looking,
to his father, who was puzzled, and did not know how to understand
the young woman's eyes.</p>

<p>“I'll never make much of a speech in Parliament,” said
Clarence; “unless you make it for me,” he added in an
undertone. But no one else was speaking, and the undertone
was quite audible. Meanwhile Phœbe had not ceased to look
at his father, and held him with a pair of eyes not like the
Ancient Mariner's. Mr. Copperhead was confused, his power
even of insolence was cowed for the moment. He obeyed
quite docilely the movement made to leave the table. Was it
possible that she defied him, this Minister's daughter, and
measured her strength against his? Mr. Copperhead felt
as if he could have shaken the impertinent girl, but dared not,
being where he was.</p>

<p>And lunch being over, Mr. May led his pupil's father into
his study. “I want to show you what your boy has been
doing,” he said, pointing to a line of books which made the
millionnaire's soul shrink within him. “I have not bothered
him with classics; what was the use as he is not going back to
Oxford? but I have done my best for him in a practical way.
He has read history, largely as you see, and as much as I could
give him of political and constitutional—”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Mr. Copperhead, reading the titles of some
of the books under his breath. They impressed him deeply,
and took away for a moment his self-confidence. It was his
habit to boast that he knew nothing about books; but in their
presence he shrank, feeling that they were greater than he,
which was, there is little doubt, a sign of grace.</p>

<p>“If you wish to remove Clarence,” said Mr. May, “perhaps
I had better make out a scheme of reading for him.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” cried the rich man, “I didn't want to remove
him; but there he is, the first I see of him, cheek for jowl
with a good-looking girl. I don't mean to say a word against
Miss May, I've no doubt she's charming; but anyhow there
she is side by side with Clar, who is no more able to resist that
sort of thing—”</p>

<p>Mr. May laughed, and this time with unmitigated amusement.
“Do you mean Ursula? I think I can answer for it
that she made no attempts upon him for which resistance
would be necessary.”</p>

<p>“That's all very well to say; but bless you they do it, every
one,” said Mr. Copperhead, “without exception, when a young
fellow's well off and well-looking; and as if one wasn't bad
enough, you've got Phœbe Beecham. You won't tell me she
doesn't mean anything?—up to any mischief, a real minister's
daughter. I don't mean anything uncivil to you or yours. I
suppose a parson's different; but we know what a minister's
daughter is in our connection. Like the men themselves, in
short, who are always pouncing on some girl with a fortune if
her relations don't take care. And Clarence is as weak as a
baby; he takes after his mother—a poor bit of a feeble creature,
though he's like me in exterior. That's how it is, you perceive;
I don't quite see my way to letting him go on.”</p>

<p>“That is of course precisely as you please,” said Mr. May,
somewhat sharply. He would preserve his dignity even though
his heart was sinking; but he could not keep that tone of
sharpness out of his voice.</p>

<p>“Of course it is as I please. I'll pay up of course for the
second three months, if you choose, fair and square. I meant
him to stay, and I'll pay. But that's all. You've no further
claim upon me that I know of; and I must say that for a
tutor, a regular coach, to keep girls in his house, daughters, or
whatever you choose to call them, is something monstrous.
It's a thing no fellow's friends would put up with. It's what
I call dishonourable.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Mr. May, with all the self-possession he was
master of, “you will let your son know at once that he must
pack and go. I dare say, Sir Robert can take him, and we will
send the portmanteaux. In such a case, it is better there
should not be a moment's delay.”</p>

<p>“Clarence!” cried Mr. Copperhead, walking to the door
and opening it. “Come along, look sharp, you're to go. I'll
take you with me, do you hear? And May will see to sending
you your boxes. Quick, come along, there's no time to lose.”</p>

<p>“Go!” said Clarence, coming in startled, with his eyebrows
rising almost into his hair. “Go? What do you mean?
Out of the Parsonage? The Governor's been having too much
sherry,” he said, coming close to Mr. May's arm; he had himself
been taking too much of the sherry, for the good reason
that nobody had taken any notice of what he did, and that he
had foreseen the excitement that was coming. “You don't
mean it, I know,” he added aloud; “I'll go over for the night
if Sir Robert will have me, and see my mother—”</p>

<p>“Ask May,” said Mr. Copperhead, “you'll believe him, I
suppose; he's as glad to get rid of you as I am to take you
away.”</p>

<p>“Is this true?” cried Clarence, roused and wondering,
“and if so, what's happened? I ain't a baby, you know, to
be bundled about from one to another. The Governor forgets
that.”</p>

<p>“Your father,” said Mr. May, “chooses to remove you, and
that is all I choose to say.”</p>

<p>“But, by George, I can say a deal more,” said Mr. Copperhead.
“You simpleton, do you think I am going to leave
you here where there's man-traps about? None of such nonsense
for me. Put your things together, I tell you. Phœbe
Beecham's bad enough at home; but if she thinks she's to have
you here to pluck at her leisure, she and her friends—”</p>

<p>“W—hew!” said Clarence, with a long whistle. “So
that's it. I am very sorry, father, if these are your sentiments;
but I may as well tell you at once I shan't go.”</p>

<p>“You—must go.”</p>

<p>“No,” he said, squaring his shoulders and putting out his
shirt front; he had never been roused into rebellion before,
and perhaps without these extra glasses of sherry he would not
have had the courage now. But what with sherry, and what
with <i>amour propre</i>, and what with the thing he called love,
Clarence Copperhead mounted all at once upon a pedestal.
He had a certain dogged obstinacy in him, suspected by nobody
but his mother, who had little enough to say in the guidance
of her boy. He set himself square like a pugilist, which was
his notion of resistance. Mr. May looked on with a curious
mixture of feelings. His own sudden and foolish hope was
over, and what did it matter to him whether the detestable
father or the coarse son should win? He turned away from
them with contempt, which was made sharp by their utter uselessness
to himself. Had it been possible that he might have
what he wanted from Mr. Copperhead, his patience would have
held out against any trial; but the moment that hope was over,
what further interest had he in the question? He went to his
writing-table and sat down there, leaving them to fight it out
as they would, by themselves. It was no affair of his.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"/>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>
<h3>A PLEASANT EVENING.</h3>


<p>The result, however, was a compromise. Clarence Copperhead
went off with his father and Sir Robert to the Hall for
the night, but was to return next day, and Phœbe was left in
a condition of some excitement behind them, not quite knowing
what to think. She was as sure as ever that he had made
up his mind to propose; but he had not done it, and what effect
his father's visit, and perhaps his mother's entreaties, might
have upon him, Phœbe could not tell. The crisis excited her
beyond any excitement which she would have thought possible
in respect to Clarence Copperhead. She was more like an
applicant for office kept uncertain whether she was to have a
desirable post or not, than a girl on the eve of a lover's declaration.
This was her own conception of the circumstances. She
did not dislike Clarence; quite the reverse. She had no sympathy
with Ursula's impatience of his heavy vanity. Phœbe
had been used to him all her life, and had never thought
badly of the heavy boy whom she had been invited to amuse
when she was six years old, and whom she had no particular
objection to amuse still, let the others wonder at her as they
might. Poor Reginald, contemplating bitterly her many little
complacencies to his rival, set them down hastily to an appreciation
of that rival's worldly advantages, which was not quite
a just sentence. It was true, and yet it was not true; other
feelings mingled in Phœbe's worldliness. She did, indeed, perceive
and esteem highly the advantages which Clarence could
give her; but she had not the objections to Clarence himself
that the others had. She was willing, quite willing, to undertake
the charge of him, to manage, and guide, and make a man
of him. And yet, while it was not pure worldliness, much less
was it actual love which moved her. It was a kind of habitual
affection, as for the “poor thing, but mine own, sir,” of the
jester. He was but a poor creature, but Phœbe knew she
could make something of him, and she had no distaste to the
task. When she began to perceive that Reginald, in so many
ways Clarence's superior, was at her disposal, a sense of gratification
went through Phœbe's mind, and it certainly occurred
to her that the feeling he might inspire would be a warmer and
a more delightful one than that which would fall to Clarence
Copperhead; but she was not tempted thereby to throw
Clarence off for the other. No, she was pleased, and not unwilling
to expend a little tender regret and gratitude upon
poor Reginald. She was ready to be “kind” to him, though
every woman knows that is the last thing she ought to be to a
rejected lover; and she was full of sympathy for the disappointment
which, nevertheless, she fully intended was to be his lot.
This seems paradoxical, but it is no more paradoxical than
human creatures generally are. On this particular evening
her heart beat very high on account of Clarence, to know if he
would have strength of mind to hold his own against his father,
and if he would come back to her and ask her, as she felt certain
he meant to do, that one momentous question. Her heart
would not have been broken had he not done so, but still she
would have been disappointed. Notwithstanding when the
evening came, the absence of Clarence was a relief to Phœbe
as well as to the rest of the party, and she gave herself up to
the pleasures of a few hours of half-tender intercourse with
Reginald, with a sense of enjoyment such as she seldom felt.
This was very wrong, there is no denying it, but still so it was.
She was anxious that Clarence should come back to her, and
ask her to be his wife; and yet she was pleased to be rid of
Clarence, and to give her whole attention and sympathy to
Reginald, trying her best to please him. It was very wrong;
and yet such things have happened before, and will again;
and are as natural, perhaps, as the more absolute and unwavering
passion which has no doubt of its object, passion like Northcote's,
who had neither eyes nor ears for anything but Ursula.
The four were alone together that evening, and enjoyed it
thoroughly. Clarence was away, who, to all but Phœbe, was
an interruption of their intercourse; and Mr. May was away
in his study, too much absorbed to think of any duties that
ought to have devolved upon him as chaperon; and even Janey
was out of the way, taking tea with Mrs. Hurst. So the two
young pairs sat round the table and talked; the girls, with a
mutual panic, which neither breathed to the other, keeping
together, avoiding separation into pairs. Ursula out of very
shyness and fright alone, lest another chapter of the strange,
novel, too moving love-tale might be poured into her ears;
but Phœbe with more settled purpose, to prevent any disclosure
on the part of Reginald. The evening was mixed up of
pleasure and pain to the two young men, each eager to find
himself alone with the girl whom he loved; but it is to be feared
the girls themselves had a furtive guilty enjoyment of it, which
they ought not to have had. Open and outrageous love-making
is not half so delicate a pastime as that in which
nothing distinct dare be said, but all is implication, conveyed
and understood without words. I know it is a dangerous
thing to confess, but veracity requires the confession; you may
say it was the playing of the cat with the mouse, if you wish
to give a disagreeable version of it; but, however you choose
to explain it, this was how it was.</p>

<p>It was with fear and trembling at last that Phœbe went to
the piano, which was at the other end of the room, after making
all the resistance which was possible.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, that idiot and his fiddle aren't here to-night
to interfere!” cried Reginald.</p>

<p>Phœbe shook her head at him, but ventured on no words; and
how she did exert herself on the piano, playing things which
were a great deal too classical for Reginald, who would have
preferred the simplest stock piece, under cover of which he
might have talked to her hanging over her chair, and making
belief to turn over the music! This was what he wanted, poor
fellow. He had no heart nor ears for Beethoven, which Phœbe
played to him with a tremor in her heart, and yet, the wicked
little witch, with some enjoyment too.</p>

<p>“This is not the sort of thing you play when Copperhead is
here,” he said at last, driven to resistance.</p>

<p>“Oh, we play Mendelssohn,” said Phœbe, with much show
of innocence; and then she added, “You ought to feel the compliment
if I play Beethoven to you.”</p>

<p>“So I ought, I suppose,” said Reginald. “The truth is, I
don't care for music. Don't take your hands off the keys.”</p>

<p>“Why, you have done nothing but worry me to play!”</p>

<p>“Not for the music,” said Reginald, quite satisfied to have
got his will. “Why will you not talk to me and play to me,
as I wish?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps, if I knew what you wish—” Phœbe said, in spite
of herself.</p>

<p>“Oh, how I should like to tell you! No, not Beethoven; a
little, just a little music. Heavens!” cried Reginald, as she
crashed into a fortissimo, “another sonata! Listen, I am not
equal to sonatas. Nay, Miss Beecham, play me a little nothing—talk
to me.”</p>

<p>She shook her head at him with a laugh, and went on playing
the hardest piece of music she could think of, complicating herself
in difficult chords and sudden accidentals. If there had
been anybody there to hear who could have understood, Phœbe's
performance would, no doubt, have appeared a masterpiece of
brilliant execution, as it was; but the two others were paying
not the slightest attention, and as for Reginald, he was in a
state of tantalized vexation, which half-amused himself, and
filled the performer with an exhilarating sense of successful
mischief. Northcote was trying to say—what was he not
trying to say?—to Ursula, under cover of the music, which was
the best shield he could have had; and perhaps in reality,
though Reginald was tantalized to the utmost degree of tantalization,
even he had a certain enjoyment in the saucy self-defence
which was more mischievous than cruel. He stood
behind Phœbe's chair, now and then meeting her laughing
glance with one of tender appeal and reproach, pleased to feel
himself thus isolated with her, and held an arm's-length in so
genial a way. He would have his opportunity after a while,
when there would be no piano to give her a momentary refuge,
and then he would say out all that was in his heart, with no
possible shadow of a rival to interfere with him. Angry? no;
as he stood behind her, watching her fingers fly over the keys,
a delightful calm stole over Reginald. Now and then she would
throw a half-mocking glance at him upward over her shoulder,
as she swept over the resounding board. When the sonata was
concluded, Phœbe sprang up from the piano, and went back to
the table. She proposed that they should play a game at cards,
to which Ursula agreed. The young men shrugged their
shoulders and protested; but, after all, what did it matter, so
long as they were together? They fell into their places quite
naturally, the very cards assisting; and so the moments flew
by. There was not so much sound as usual in the old faded
drawing-room, which had come to look so bright and homelike;
not so much sound of voices, perhaps less laughter—yet of all
the evenings they had spent there together, that was the one
they looked back upon, all four, with most tender recollection.
They had been so happy, or, if not happy, so near (apparently)
to happiness, which is better sometimes than happiness itself.</p>

<p>“Don't let Reginald come with me,” Phœbe whispered, as
she kissed her friend, and said good night, “or ask Mr. Northcote
to come too.”</p>

<p>“Why?” said Ursula, with dreamy eyes; her own young
tide of life was rising, invading, for the moment, her perceptions,
and dulling her sense of what was going on round her.
There was no time, however, for anything more to be said, for
Reginald was close behind with his hat in his hand. Phœbe
had to resign herself, and she knew what was coming. The
only thing was, if possible, to stop the declaration on the
way.</p>

<p>“This is the first chance I have had of seeing you home without
that perpetual shadow of Copperhead—”</p>

<p>“Ah, poor Clarence!” said Phœbe. “I wonder how he is
getting on away from us all to-night.”</p>

<p>“Poor Clarence!” echoed Reginald aghast. “You don't
mean to say that you—miss him, Miss Beecham? I never
heard you speak of him in that tone before.”</p>

<p>“Miss him! no, perhaps not exactly,” said Phœbe, with a
soft little sigh; “but still—I have known him all my life, Mr.
May; when we were quite little I used to be sent for to his
grand nursery, full of lovely toys and things—a great deal
grander than mine.”</p>

<p>“And for that reason—” said Reginald, becoming bitter,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Nothing for that reason,” said Phœbe; “but I noticed it
at six as I should at twenty. I must have been a horrid little
worldly-minded thing, don't you think? So you see there are
the associations of a great many years to make me say Poor
Clarence, when anything is the matter with him.”</p>

<p>“He is lucky to rouse your sympathies so warmly,” cried
Reginald, thoroughly wretched; “but I did not know there
was anything the matter.”</p>

<p>“I think there will be if he has to leave our little society,
where we have all been so happy,” said Phœbe, softly. “How
little one thought, coming here a stranger, how pleasant it
was to be! I especially, to whom coming to Carlingford was
rather—perhaps I might say a humiliation. I am very fond
of grandpapa and grandmamma now, but the first introduction
was something of a shock—I have never denied it; and if it
had not been for sweet kind Ursula and you—all.”</p>

<p>The little breathless fragmentary pause which Phœbe made
between the you and the “all,” giving just a ghost of emphasis
to the pronoun, sounded to poor Reginald in his foolishness
almost like a caress. How cleverly it was managed, with just
so much natural feeling in it as gave it reality! They were
approaching No. 6, and Martha, the maid, already was visible
at the open door.</p>

<p>“Then you do give me some share—some little share,” he
cried, with a broken voice. “Ah, if you would only let me tell
you what your coming has been to me. It has opened up my
life; I feel everything different, the old earth itself; there is a
new light upon the whole world—”</p>

<p>“Hush, here is Martha!” cried Phœbe, “she will not understand
about new lights. Yes, it has been pleasant, very
pleasant; when one begins to sigh and realize how pleasant a
thing has been, I always fear it is going to be broken up.”</p>

<p>“<i>Absit omen!</i>” cried Reginald, fervently, taking the hand
she had put out to bid him good night, and holding it fast to
detain her; and was there moisture in the eyes which she lifted
to him, and which glistened, he thought, though there was only
the distant light of a lamp to see them by?</p>

<p>“You must not keep me now,” cried Phœbe, “here is grandpapa
coming. Good night, Mr. May, good night.”</p>

<p>Was Phœbe a mere coquette <i>pure et simple</i>? As soon as
she had got safe within these walls, she stooped down over the
primroses to get rid of Martha, and then in the darkness had
a cry, all by herself, on one side of the wall, while the
young lover, with his head full of her, checked, but not altogether
discouraged, went slowly away on the other. She cried,
and her heart contracted with a real pang. He was very tender
in his reverential homage, very romantic, a true lover, not the
kind of man who wants a wife or wants a clever companion to
amuse him, and save him the expense of a coach, and be his to
refer to in everything. That was an altogether different kind
of thing. Phœbe went in with a sense in her mind that perhaps
she had never touched so close upon a higher kind of existence,
and perhaps never again might have the opportunity; but before
she had crossed the garden, she had begun once more to question
whether Clarence would have the fortitude to hold his own
against everything that father or mother could do to change his
mind. Would he have the fortitude? Would he come back to
her, safe and determined, or would he yield to arguments in favour
of some richer bride, and come back either estranged or at the
least doubtful? This gave her a pang of profound anxiety at
the bottom of her heart.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII"/>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
<h3>AN EXPEDITION.</h3>


<p>Mr. May did not come upstairs that evening. It was not
that he was paralysed as he had been on the previous occasion,
when he sat as now and heard Phœbe go away after her first
visit, and when the wind blowing in from the open door playfully
carried to his feet the scribbled note with Tozer's name.
He was not stupefied as then, nor was he miserable. The
threatened withdrawal of Clarence Copperhead was more to
him than the impending ruin meant by that bill which was so
nearly due. He was occupied by that to the exclusion of the
other. It would be a most serious change to him in every
way. He had calculated on the continuance of this additional
income for at least a year, and short of the year it would have
done him no good, but had simply plunged him into additional
expense. It was this he was thinking of, and which kept him
in his study after the young people had assembled. Cotsdean
had come again while Mr. May was at dinner, which by some
curious unconscious aggravation on his part was the time he
especially chose as most convenient for him; and he had again
sent a dirty note by Bobby, imploring his principal to think of
the impending fate, and not to desert him. Mr. May was
angry at this perpetual appeal. “Why should I desert him,
the idiot?” he said to himself; and moved by the man's persistence,
he took out his pocket-book again, and made out
beyond all chance of mistake, that it was the 18th. Why
should the fool insist upon its being the 15th with such perpetual
iteration? There were the figures as plain as possible,
18th April. Mr. May wrote a peremptory note announcing
this fact to Cotsdean, and then returned to his own thoughts.
Sir Robert had asked him to go over that morning and spend
the day at the Hall with the Copperheads, not knowing of any
breach between them. He thought he had better do this. If
Clarence determined to stay, that would be a great thing in his
favour, and he had seen that the young man's dull spirit was
roused; and if that hope failed, there might still be advantage
even in this sudden breaking of the bond. Part of the second
quarter was gone, and the father had offered three months
additional pay. These two payments would make up the
hundred and fifty pounds at once, and settle the business.
Thus, in either way, he should be safe, for if Clarence went
away the money would be paid; and if he stayed, Mr. May
himself had made up his mind to risk the bold step of going to
the bank and asking an advance on this inalienable security.
All these deliberations made his mind easy about the bill. It
must come right one way or another; he might have chosen
perhaps not to run it quite so close; but after all the 15th was
only to-morrow, and there were still three days. While his
mind was full of these things he did not care to go upstairs.
He heard the voices of the young people, but he was too much
engrossed with his own calculations to care to join them. It
was a close thing, he said to himself, a very close thing; but
still he felt that he could do it—surely he could do it. If Mr.
Copperhead settled with him—and he was the sort of man, a
man to whom money was nothing, to do so on the spot if he
took it into his head—then all was right. And if Mr. Copperhead
did not do so, the bank, though his past transactions
with it had not been encouraging, would certainly make all right
on account of these Copperhead payments, which were as
certain as any payments could be. He went to bed early, being
engrossed by these thoughts, not even saying good-night to
Ursula, as was his wont; and he made up his mind to take an
early breakfast, and start the first thing in the morning for the
Hall. There was an early train which would suit admirably.
He could not afford to drive, as Sir Robert had done, changing
horses half way. He went upstairs to bed, somewhat heavily,
but not discontented, seeing his way. After all, the great
thing in life is to see your way. It does not matter so much
whether that way is great or small, so long as you can see it
plain before you. Mr. May breathed a sigh of anxiety as he
ended the day. He had a great many things on his mind; but
still he was not altogether heavy-hearted or discouraged beyond
measure; things, he felt, would shape themselves better than
he had hoped. He was not perhaps going to be so much better
off than of old, as he thought possible when Clarence Copperhead
came. Such delusive prospects do glimmer across a poor
man's path when any apparent expansion of means occurs to
him; but in the majority of cases he has to consent to see
the fine fictitious glow die away. Mr. May was not ignorant
of this experience already. A man who is over fifty is generally
more or less prepared for anything that can happen to him
in this kind; but he thought he could “get on;” and after all
that is the sum of life to three parts of mankind.</p>

<p>He was silent at breakfast, but not disagreeable, and Ursula
was too much taken up with her own concerns to pay much
attention to him. Ursula's concerns were developing with a
rapidity altogether extraordinary. In the mind of a girl of
twenty, unforestalled by any previous experience, the process
that goes on between the moment when the surprising, overwhelming
discovery rushes upon her that some one loves her
in the old way of romance, until the corresponding moment
when she finds out that her own heart too has been invaded by
this wonderful sentiment, which is like nothing that was ever
known before, is of a very rapid description. It is like the
bursting of a flower, which a day's sunshine brings to the
blooming point like a miracle, though it is in reality the simplest
result of nature. Already there began to glow a haze of
brightness about those three months past in which everything
had begun. When or how it began she could not now tell.
The glow of it was in her eyes and dazzled her. She heard the
voices of the others sounding vaguely through this bright mist
in which she herself was isolated; when she was obliged to
reply, she called herself back with an effort, and did so—but of
her own will she seldom spoke. How Janey chattered, how
the children maundered on about their little concerns, which
were of consequence to nobody! Papa was the person whom
Ursula really respected this morning, for he had more sense
than to talk. How could people talk, as if there was pleasure
in that? But papa had more sense, he had things to think of—too.
So the girl approved her father, and thought more
highly of him, and never inquired what it might be that occupied
his mind, and kept him from noticing even when the
children were unruly. And it would be giving the reader an
unfair idea of the children, if we attempted to conceal that they
did take advantage of their opportunities, and were as unruly
as well-conditioned children in the circumstances were likely
to be. Mr. May took no notice; he took his coffee hurriedly
and went off to the station.</p>

<p>“If I don't return this evening you need not be alarmed. I
shall come back at the latest to-morrow morning,” he said.</p>

<p>The children all rushed to the window to see him go away;
even Ursula looking out dreamily remarked him too, as she
seldom did; and Mrs. Sam Hurst at her window, wondering
where her neighbour could be going, heaved a deep sigh of
admiration, which though she was not “in love,” as the girls
thought, with Mr. May, was a passing tribute to his good looks
and training. He looked a gentleman every inch of him—an
English gentleman, spotless in linen, speckless in broadcloth,
though his dress was far from new; the freshness of sound
health and a clear conscience on his handsome face, though he
was no longer young. His abundant hair, steel-grey, slightly
crisped under his hat, not curling exactly, but with a becoming
twist in it—clerical, yet not too clerical, a man given to no
extremes, decorously churchmanlike, yet liberal and tolerant of
the world. Though she was too wise to compromise her own
comfort by marrying him, Mrs. Hurst felt that there was a
great pleasure in making his daughters anxious about her
“intentions,” and that even to be said to be in love with such
a man was no shame, but rather the reverse.</p>

<p>He went away accordingly, taking a short cut to the railway,
and thus missing Cotsdean, who came breathless ten minutes
after he was gone, and followed him to the train; but too late.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” Cotsdean said to himself, wiping his forehead,
“Old Tozer has plenty, it ain't nothing to him to pay. They
can settle it between 'em.”</p>

<p>Cotsdean himself was easier in his mind than he had ever
been before on such an occasion. His clergyman, though personally
an awful and respect-inspiring personage, was so far as
money went a man of straw, as he well knew, and his name on
a bill was very little worth; but Tozer was a man who could
pay his way. A hundred and fifty pounds, or even ten times
that, would not ruin the old shopkeeper. Cotsdean's sense of
commercial honour was not so very keen that the dishonouring
of his bill in the circumstances should give him a very
serious pang. He would not be sold up, or have an execution
put into his shop when the other party to the bill was so substantial
a person. Of course Tozer, when he signed it, must
have been told all about it, and Cotsdean did not see how with
two such allies against ruin, anything very serious could befall
him. He was uneasy indeed, but his uneasiness had no such
force in it as before. He went back to his shop and his business
prepared to take the matter as calmly as possible. He
was but passive in it. It could not harm him much in the eyes
of his banker, who knew his affairs too well to be much astonished
at any such incident, and Tozer and Mr. May must settle
it between them. It was their affair.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. May rattled along in the railway towards
the Hall. He got a dog-cart at the little inn at the station to
take him over, though generally when he went to see the
Dorsets it was his custom to walk. “But what were a few
shillings?” he said to himself, the prodigality of desperation
having seized upon him. In any case he could pay that, and
if he was to be ruined, what did a few shillings more or less
matter? but the discomfort of walking over those muddy
roads, and arriving with dirty boots and a worn-out aspect,
mattered a great deal. He reached the Hall at a propitious
moment, when Mr. Copperhead was in the highest good-humour.
He had been taken over the place, from one end to
another, over the stables, the farm-buildings, the farm itself
from end to end, the preserves, the shrubberies, the greenhouses,
everything; all of which details he examined with an
unfailing curiosity which would have been highly flattering to
the possessors if it had not been neutralized by a strain of
comment which was much less satisfactory. When Mr. May
went in, he found him in the dining-room, with Sir Robert
and his daughters standing by, clapping his wings and crowing
loudly over a picture which the Dorsets prized much. It represented
a bit of vague Italian scenery, mellow and tranquil,
and was a true “Wilson,” bought by an uncle of Sir Robert's,
who had been a connoisseur, from the Master himself, in the
very country where it was painted; and all these details pleased
the imagination of the family, who, though probably they
would have been but mildly delighted had they possessed the
acquaintance of the best of contemporary painters, were proud
that Uncle Charles had known Italian Wilson, and had bought
a picture out of his studio. A Hobbema or a Poussin would
scarcely have pleased them as much, for the worst of an old
Master is that your friends look suspiciously upon it as a copy;
whereas Wilson is scarcely old enough or precious enough to
be copied. They were showing their picture and telling the
story to the millionnaire with an agreeable sense that, though
they were not so rich, they must, at least, have the advantage
of him in this way.</p>

<p>“Ha!” said Mr. Copperhead, “you should see my Turner.
Didn't I show you my Turner? I don't venture to tell you,
Sir Robert, what that picture cost me. It's a sin, it is, to keep
that amount of capital hanging useless upon a bit of wall. The
Wilson may be all very well. I ain't a judge of art, and I can't
give my opinion on that point, though it's a common sort of a
name, and there don't seem to be much in it; but everybody
knows what a Turner means. Here's May; he'll be able to
tell you as well as another. It means a few cool thousands,
take my word for it. It means, I believe, that heaps of people
would give you your own price. I don't call it a profitable investment,
for it brings in no interest; but they tell me it's a
thing that grows in value every year. And there it is, Sir,
hanging up useless on my wall in Portland Place, costing a
fortune, and bringing in not a penny. But I like it; I like it,
for I can afford it, by George! Here's May; he knows what
that sort of thing is; he'll tell you that a Turner is worth its
weight in gold.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, I don't think I need any information on that
subject,” said Sir Robert. “Besides, I saw your Turner. It
is a pretty picture—if it is authentic; but Wilson, you
know—”</p>

<p>“Wasn't a big-enough swell not to be authentic, eh?” said
Mr. Copperhead. “Common name enough, and I don't know
that I ever heard of him in the way of painting; but I don't
pretend to be a judge. Here's May; now, I dare say he knows
all about it. Buying's one thing, knowing's another. Your
knowing ones, when they've got any money, they have the advantage
over us, Sir Robert; they can pick up a thing that's good,
when it happens to come their way, dirt cheap; but fortunately
for us, it isn't often they've got any money,” he added, with a
laugh, slapping Mr. May on the shoulder in a way which made him
totter. But the clergyman's good-humour was equal even to
this assault. It is wonderful how patient and tolerant we can
all be when the motive is strong enough.</p>

<p>“That is true,” he said; “but I fear I have not even the
compensation of knowledge. I know enough, however, to feel
that the possessor of a Turner is a public personage, and may
be a public benefactor if he pleases.”</p>

<p>“How that? If you think I am one to go lending my
pictures about, or leaving them to the nation when I'm done
for, that's not my sort. No, I keep them to myself. If I consent
to have all that money useless, it is for myself, you may
depend, and not for other people. And I'll leave it to my boy
Clarence, if he behaves himself. He's a curiosity, too, and has
a deal of money laid out on him that brings no interest, him
and his mother. I'll leave it to Clar, if he doesn't make a low
marriage, or any folly of that kind.”</p>

<p>“You should make it an heir-loom,” said Sir Robert, with
sarcasm too fine for his antagonist; “leave it from father to son
of your descendants, like our family diamonds and plate.”</p>

<p>Anne and Sophy looked at each other and smiled, the one
sadly, the other satirically. The Dorset family jewels were
rose-diamonds of small value, and the plate was but moderate
in quantity, and not very great in quality. Poor Sir Robert
liked to blow his little trumpet too, but it was not so blatant as
that of his visitor, whose rude senses did not even see the
intended malice.</p>

<p>“By George! I think I will,” he said. “I'm told it's as
safe as the bank, and worth more and more every year, and if it
don't bring in anything, it don't eat anything; eh, May? Look
here; perhaps I was hasty the other day,” he said, pushing the
clergyman a little apart from the group with a large hand on his
shoulder. “Clarence tells me you're the best coach he ever saw,
and that he's getting on like a house on fire.”</p>

<p>“He does make progress, I think,” answered the tutor, thus
gracefully complimented.</p>

<p>“But all the same, you know, I had a right to be annoyed.
Now a man of your sense—for you seem a man of sense, though
you're a parson, and know what side your bread's buttered
on—ought to see that it's an aggravating thing when a young
fellow has been sent to a coach for his instruction, and to keep
him out of harm's way, to find him cheek by jowl with a nice-looking
young woman. That's not what a father has a right
to expect.”</p>

<p>“You couldn't expect me to do away with my daughter because
I happened to take a pupil?” said Mr. May, half-amused;
“but I can assure you that she has no designs upon your son.”</p>

<p>“So I hear, so I hear,” said the other, with a mixture of
pique and satisfaction. “Won't look at him, Clar tells me; got
her eye on some one else, little fool! She'll never have such
a chance again. As for having no designs, that's bosh, you
know; all women have designs. I'm a deal easier in my mind
when I'm told she's got other fish to fry.”</p>

<p>“Other fish to fry?” said Mr. May; this time he was
wholly amused, and laughed. “This is news to me. However,
we don't want to discuss my little Ursula; about your
son it will be well that I should know, for I might be forming
other engagements. This moment is a time of pecuniary
pressure with me,” he added, with the ingratiating smile and
half-pathetic frankness of the would-be borrower. “I have
not taken pupils before, but I want money for the time. My
son's settlement in life, you see, and—but the father of a large
family can always find good reasons for wanting money.”</p>

<p>“That's it,” said Mr. Copperhead, seriously. “Why are you
the father of a large family? That's what I ask our ministers.
It's against all political economy, that is. According as you've
no money to give 'em, you go and have children—when it
should be just the other way.”</p>

<p>“That may be very true; but there they are, and can't be
done away with; and I do want money, as it happens, more
now than I shall want it a year hence, or, perhaps, even six
months hence.”</p>

<p>“Most people do,” said Mr. Copperhead, withdrawing his
hand from his pocket, and placing his elbow tightly against
the orifice of that very important part of him. “It's the commonest
thing in the world. I want money myself, for that matter.
I've always got a large amount to make up by a certain date,
and a bill to pay. But about Clar, that's the important matter.
As he seems to have set his mind on it, and as you assure me
there's no danger—man-traps, or that sort of thing, eh?”</p>

<p>The colour came to Mr. May's cheek; but it was only for a
moment. To have his own daughter spoken of as a man-trap
gave him a momentary thrill of anger; but, as he would have
applied the word quite composedly to any other man's daughter,
the resentment was evanescent. He did not trust himself to
answer, however, but nodded somewhat impatiently, which made
the millionnaire laugh the more.</p>

<p>“Don't like the man-trap?” he said. “Bless you, they're all
alike, not yours more than the rest. But as I was saying, if
it's warranted safe I suppose he'll have to stay. But I don't
stand any nonsense, May; and look here, your music and all
that ain't in the agreement. He can have a master for his
music, he's well enough able to pay for it; but I won't have a
mistress, by George, to put folly into his head.”</p>

<p>“I am to forbid him the drawing-room, I suppose, and take
his fiddle from him! I have no objections. Between ourselves,
as I am not musical, it would be very agreeable to me; but
perhaps he is rather over the age, don't you think, for treatment
of that kind?”</p>

<p>Clarence had come in, and stood watching the conversation,
with a look Mr. Copperhead was not prepared for. Those
mild brown eyes, which were his mother's share in him, were
full a-stare with sullen resolution, and his heavy mouth shut
like that of a bull-dog. He lingered at the door, looking at
the conversation which was going on between his father and his
tutor, and they both noticed him at the same moment, and
drew the same conclusion. Mr. May was in possession of the
<i>parole</i>, as the French say, and he added instinctively in an
undertone,</p>

<p>“Take care; if I were you I would not try him too far.”</p>

<p>Mr. Copperhead said nothing; but he stared too, rather
aghast at this new revelation. What! his porcelain, his Dresden
figure of a son, his crowning curiosity, was <i>he</i> going to show
a will of his own? The despot felt a thrill go over him. What
kind of a sentiment love was in his mind it would be hard to
tell; but his pride was all set on this heavy boy. To see him
a man of note, in Parliament, his name in the papers, his
speeches printed in the “Times,” was the very heaven of his
expectations. “Son of the famous Copperhead, the great contractor.”
He did not care about such distinction in his own
person; but this had been his dream ever since Clarence came
into being. And now there he stood gloomy, obdurate. If he
had made up his mind to make a low marriage, could his father
hinder him—could anything hinder him? Mr. Copperhead
looked at his son and quailed for the first time in his life.</p>

<p>“May,” he said, hurriedly, “do the best you can; he's got
all his mother's d——d obstinacy, you can see, can't you? but
I've set my heart on making a man of him—do the best you
can.”</p>

<p>Mr. May thought to himself afterwards if he had only had
the vigour to say, “Pay me six months in advance,” the thing
would have been done. But the lingering prejudices of breeding
clung about him, and he could not do it. Mr. Copperhead,
however, was very friendly all the rest of the day, and gave him
private looks and words aside, to the great admiration of the
Dorsets, to whom the alliance between them appeared remarkable
enough.</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XXXIX"/>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
<h3>A CATASTROPHE.</h3>


<p>Mr. May left the Hall before dinner, notwithstanding the
warm invitation which was given to him to stay. He was
rather restless, and though it was hard to go out into the dark
just as grateful odours began to steal through the house, it
suited him better to do so than to spend the night away from
home. Besides, he comforted himself that Sir Robert's cook
was not first-rate, not good enough to make it a great temptation.
It was a long walk to the station, for they had no horses
at liberty to drive him, a fact at which he was slightly offended,
though he was aware that Sir Robert's stable was but a poor
one. He set out just as the dressing-bell began to ring, fortified
with a glass of sherry and a biscuit. The night was mild and
soft, the hedgerows all rustling with the new life of the spring,
and the stars beginning to come out as he went on; and on the
whole the walk was pleasant, though the roads were somewhat
muddy. As he went along, he felt himself fall into a curious
dreamy state of mind, which was partly fatigue perhaps, but
was not at all unpleasant. Sometimes he almost seemed to
himself to be asleep as he trudged on, and woke up with a start,
thinking that he saw indistinct figures, the skirt of a dress or
the tail of a long coat, disappearing past him, just gone before
he was fully awake to what it was. He knew there was no
one on the lonely road, and that this was a dream or illusion,
but still he kept seeing these vanishings of indistinct wayfarers,
which did not frighten him in the least, but half-amused him
in the curious state of his brain. He had got rid of his anxiety.
It was all quite plain before him what to do,—to go to the Bank,
to tell them what he had coming in, and to settle everything as
easily as possible. The consciousness of having this to do acted
upon him like a gentle opiate or dream-charm. When he got to
the railway station, and got into a carriage, he seemed to be floating
somehow in a prolonged vision of light and streaks of darkness,
not quite aware now far he was going, or where he was going,
across the country; and even when he arrived at Carlingford he
roused himself with difficulty, not quite certain that he had to
get out; then he smiled at himself, seeing the gas-lights in a sort
of vague glimmer about him, not uncomfortable, but misty and
half-asleep. “If Sir Robert's sherry had been better, I should
have blamed that,” he said to himself; and in fact it was a kind
of drowsy, amiable mental intoxication which affected him, he
scarcely could tell how. When he got within sight of his own
house, he paused a moment and looked up at the lights in the
windows. There was music going on; Phœbe, no doubt, for
Ursula could not play so well as that, and the house looked full
and cheerful. He had a cheerful home, there was no doubt of
that. Young Copperhead, though he was a dunce, felt it, and
showed an appreciation of better things in his determination
not to leave the house where he had been so happy. Mr. May
felt an amiable friendliness stealing over him for Clarence too.</p>

<p>Upstairs in the drawing-room another idyllic evening had
begun. Phœbe “had not intended to come,” but was there
notwithstanding, persuaded by Ursula, who, glad for once to
escape from the anxieties of dinner, had celebrated tea with
the children, to their great delight, though she was still too
dreamy and pre-occupied to respond much to them. And
Northcote had “not intended to come.” Indeed, he had gone
further than this, he had intended to keep away. But when he
had eaten his solitary dinner, he, too, had strayed towards the
centre of attraction, and walking up and down in forlorn contemplation
of the lighted windows, had been spied by Reginald,
and brought in after a faint resistance. So the four were
together again, with only Janey to interpose an edge of general
criticism and remark into the too personal strain of the conversation.
Janey did not quite realize the importance of the
place she was occupying, but she was keenly interested in all
that was going on, very eager to understand the relationships
in which the others stood, and to see for herself what progress
had been made last night while she was absent. Her sharp
girlish face, in which the eyes seemed too big for the features,
expressed a totally different phase of existence from that which
softened and subdued the others. She was all eyes and ears,
and watchful scrutiny. It was she who prevented the utterance
of the half-dozen words trembling on Northcote's lips, to
which Ursula had a soft response fluttering somewhere in her
pretty throat, but which was not destined to be spoken to-night;
and it was she who made Phœbe's music quite a simple
performance, attended with little excitement and no danger.
Phœbe was the only one who was grateful to her, and perhaps
even Phœbe could have enjoyed the agitations of the evening
better had Janey been away. As it was, these agitations were
all suppressed and incipient; they could not come to anything;
there were no hairbreadth escapes, no breathless moments, when
the one pursued had to exercise her best skill, and only eluded
the pursuer by a step or two. Janey, with all her senses about
her, hearing everything, seeing everything, neutralized all effort
on the part of the lovers, and reduced the condition of Ursula
and Phœbe to one of absolute safety. They were all kept on
the curb, in the leash, by the presence of this youthful
observer; and the evening, though full of a certain excitement
and mixture of happiness and misery, glided on but slowly,
each of the young men outdoing the other in a savage eagerness
for Janey's bed-time.</p>

<p>“Do you let her sit up till midnight every night?” said
Reginald, with indignation.</p>

<p>“Let me sit up!” cried Janey, “as if I was obliged to do
what she tells me!”</p>

<p>Ursula gave a little shrug to her pretty shoulders, and looked
at the clock.</p>

<p>“It is not midnight yet; it is not nine o'clock,” she said,
with a sigh. “I should have thought papa would have come
home before now. Can he be staying at the Hall all night?”</p>

<p>Just then, however, there was the well-known ring at the
bell, and Ursula ran downstairs to see after her father's supper.
Why couldn't Janey make herself useful and do that, the little
company thought indignantly and with one accord, instead of
staying here with her sharp eyes, putting everybody out? Mr.
May's little dinner, or supper, served on a tray, was very comfortable,
and he ate it with great satisfaction, telling Ursula
that he had, on the whole, spent a pleasant day.</p>

<p>“The Dorsets were kind, as they always are, and Mr. Copperhead
was a little less disagreeable than he always is; and you
may look for Clarence back again in a day or two. He is not
going to leave us. You must take care that he does not fall in
love with you, Ursula. That is the chief thing they seem to be
afraid of.”</p>

<p>“Fall in love with <i>me</i>!” cried Ursula. “Oh, papa, where
are your eyes? He has fallen in love, but not with me. Can't
you see it? It is Phœbe he cares for.”</p>

<p>Mr. May was startled. He raised his head with a curious
smile in his eyes, which made Ursula wonder painfully whether
her father had taken much wine at the Hall.</p>

<p>“Ah, ha! is that what they are frightened for?” he said,
and then he shrugged his shoulders. “She will show bad taste,
Ursula; she might do better; but I suppose a girl of her class
has not the delicacy—So that is what they are frightened for!
And what are the other fish <i>you</i> have to fry?”</p>

<p>“Papa!”</p>

<p>“Yes. He told me he was not alarmed about you; that you
had other fish to fry, eh! Well, it's too late for explanations
to-night. What's that? Very odd, I thought I saw some one
going out at the door—just a whiff of the coat-tails. I think
my digestion must be out of order. I'll go into the study and
get my pills, and then I think I'll go to bed.”</p>

<p>“Won't you come upstairs to the drawing-room?” said
Ursula, faltering, for she was appalled by the idea of explanations.
What had she to explain, as yet? Mr. May shook his
head, with that smile still upon his face.</p>

<p>“No, you'll get on excellently well without me. I've had a
long walk, and I think I'll go to bed.”</p>

<p>“You don't look very well, papa.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I'm well enough; only confused in the head a little
with fatigue and the things I've had to think about. Good-night.
Don't keep those young fellows late, though one of
them is your brother. You can say I'm tired. Good-night,
my dear.”</p>

<p>It was very seldom that he called her “my dear,” or, indeed,
said anything affectionate to his grown-up children. If Ursula
had not been so eager to return to the drawing-room, and so
sure that “they” would miss her, she would have been anxious
about her father; but as it was, she ran upstairs lightly when
he stopped speaking, and left him going into the study, where
already his lamp was burning. Betsy passed her as she ran up
the stairs, coming from the kitchen with a letter held between
two folds of her apron. Poor papa! no doubt it was some tiresome
parish business to bother him, when he was tired already.
But Ursula did not stop for that. How she wanted to be there
again, among “them all,” even though Janey still made one!
She went in breathless, and gave her father's message only half-articulately.
He was tired. “We are never to mind; he says
so.” They all took the intimation very easily. Mr. May being
tired, what did that matter? He would, no doubt, be better
to-morrow; and in the mean time those sweet hours, though
so hampered by Janey, were very sweet.</p>

<p>Betsy went in, and put down the note before Mr. May on
his table. He was just taking out his medicine from the
drawer, and he made a wry face at the note and at the pills
together.</p>

<p>“Parish?” he said, curtly.</p>

<p>“No, sir; it's from Mr. Cotsdean. He came this morning,
after you'd gone, and he sent over little Bobby.”</p>

<p>“That will do.”</p>

<p>A presentiment of pain stole over him. He gave Betsy a
nod of dismissal, and went on with what he was doing. After
he had finished, he took up the little note from the table with
a look of disgust. It was badly scrawled, badly folded, and
dirty. Thank Heaven, Cotsdean's communications would soon
be over now.</p>

<p>Janey had proposed a round game upstairs. They were all
humble in their desire to conciliate that young despot. Reginald
got the cards, and Northcote put chairs round the table.
He placed Ursula next to himself, which was a consolation, and
sat down by her, close to her, though not a word, except of the
most commonplace kind, could be said.</p>

<p>Just then—what was it? an indescribable thrill through the
house, the sound of a heavy fall. They all started up from
their seats to hear what it was. Then Ursula, with a cry of
apprehension, rushed downstairs, and the others after her.
Betsy, alarmed, had come out of the kitchen, followed by her
assistant, and was standing frightened, but irresolute; for Mr.
May was not a man to be disturbed with impunity. And this
might be nothing—the falling of a chair or a table, and nothing
more.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried Ursula, in an anxious whisper.</p>

<p>She was the leader in the emergency, for even Reginald held
back. Then, after a moment's pause, she opened the door, and
with a little cry rushed in. It was, as they feared, Mr. May
who had fallen; but he had so far recovered himself as to be
able to make efforts to rise. His face was towards them.
It was very pale, of a livid colour, and covered with moisture,
great beads standing on his forehead. He smiled vaguely when
he saw the circle of faces.</p>

<p>“Nothing—nothing—a faintness,” he faltered, making again
an effort to rise.</p>

<p>“What is it, papa? Oh, what's the matter?” cried Janey,
rushing at him and seizing him by the arm. “Get up! get
up! what will people think? Oh, Ursula, how queer he looks,
and he feels so heavy. Oh, please get up, papa!”</p>

<p>“Go away,” said Mr. May, “go away. It is—a faintness.
I am very well where I am—”</p>

<p>But he did not resist when Reginald and Northcote lifted
him from the floor. He had a piece of paper tightly clasped
in his hand. He gave them a strange suspicious look all round,
and shrank when his eyes fell upon Phœbe. “Don't let her
know,” he said. “Take me away, take me away.”</p>

<p>“Reginald will take you upstairs, papa—to your room—to
bed; you ought to go to bed. It is the long walk that has
worn you out. Oh, Reginald, don't contradict him, let him
go where he pleases. Oh, papa, where <i>are</i> you going?” cried
Ursula, “the other way; you want to go to bed.”</p>

<p>“This way, take me—somewhere,” said the sufferer; though
he could not stand he made a step, staggering between them,
and an effort to push towards the hall door, and when they
directed him in the other direction to the staircase which led
to his room, he struggled feebly yet violently with them. “No,
no, no, not there!” he cried. The sudden confusion, dismay,
and alarm into which the family was plunged, the strange sense
of a catastrophe that came upon them, cannot be told. Ursula,
calling out all the time that they were not to contradict him,
insisted imperiously with words and gestures that he should
be taken upstairs. Janey, altogether overcome, sat down on
the lower steps of the staircase and cried. Reginald almost as
pale as his father, and not saying a word, urged him towards
the stairs. To get him up to his room, resisting as well as he
could, and moaning inarticulate remonstrances all the way, was
no easy business. As the procession toiled along Phœbe was
left below, the only one in possession of her faculties. She sent
the housemaid hurriedly off for the doctor, and despatched
Betsy to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Hot water is always wanted,” said Phœbe; “see that you
have enough in case he should require a bath.”</p>

<p>Then with her usual decision she stepped back into the study.
It was not vulgar curiosity which was in Phœbe's mind, nor
did it occur to her that she had no right to investigate Mr.
May's private affairs. If she could find what had done it,
would not that be a great matter, something to tell the doctor,
to throw light on so mysterious a seizure? Several bits of
torn paper were lying on the floor; but only one of these was
big enough to contain any information. It was torn in a kind
of triangular shape, and contained a corner of a letter, a section
of three lines,</p>

<p style="text-align: right;">“must have mistaken the date<br/>
presented to-day,<br/>
paid by Tozer,”</p>

<p>was what she read. She could not believe her eyes. What
transactions could there be between her grandfather and Mr.
May? She secured the scrap of paper, furtively putting it
into her pocket. It was better to say nothing either to the
doctor, or any one else, of anything so utterly incomprehensible.
It oppressed Phœbe with a sense of mystery and of
personal connection with the mystery, which even her self-possession
could scarcely bear up against. She went into the
kitchen after Betsy, avowedly in anxious concern for the boiling
of the kettle.</p>

<p>“Hot water is good for everything,” said Phœbe; “mamma
says a hot bath is the best of remedies. Did Mr. May have
anything—to worry him, Betsy? I suppose it is only fatigue,
and that he has taken too long a walk.”</p>

<p>“I don't believe in the long walk, Miss,” said Betsy, “it's
that Cotsdean as is always a-tormenting with his dirty letters.
When that man comes bothering here, master is always put out.”</p>

<p>“Cotsdean? I don't know the name.”</p>

<p>“Don't say nothing, Miss,” said Betsy, sinking her voice,
“but you take my word it's money. Money's at the bottom
of everything. It's something, as sure as you're alive, as
master has got to pay. I've been a deal with gentlefolks,”
added Betsy, “and ne'er a one of them can abide that.”</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XL"/>CHAPTER XL.</h2>
<h3>THE SINNED-AGAINST.</h3>


<p>Phœbe's mind was full of many and somewhat agitating
thoughts. She went upstairs with a restless haste, which she
would have been the first to condemn, to the room where the
others were congregated, when they had laid Mr. May on his
bed with no small difficulty, and were now consulting what to
do. Ursula had fallen a little from the position of command
she had taken up. To get him to bed, to send for the doctor,
these were evident practical steps to take; but after having
done these she was bewildered and fell back upon her advisers.</p>

<p>“We can't do anything, we can only wait and watch him,”
Reginald was saying, as Phœbe, herself unseen, looked in at
the anxious party; and without asking any question she turned
and went downstairs again, and hastily putting on her shawl
and hat, went out, shutting the door softly, and ran home on
the shady side of Grange Lane, where nobody could see her.
It was a very quiet road, and she was not disturbed by any unreasonable
alarms. It was still early when she got home,
earlier than usual, and her intention was not to stay there at
all, but to go back again and offer her assistance to Ursula,
for whom she had left a message to this effect. Phœbe was
full of genuine regard and friendliness towards the Mays.</p>

<p>She felt that she had obligations to all of them, to the
parson-father for submitting to her presence, nay, encouraging
it, and to Ursula for receiving her with that affectionate fervour
of friendship which had completely changed the tenor of
Phœbe's life at Carlingford. She was obliged to them, and
she knew that she was obliged to them. How different these
three months would have been but for the Parsonage; what a
heavy leaden-coloured existence without variety and without
interest she must have lived; whereas it had gone by like a
summer day, full of real life, of multiplied interests, of everything
that it was most desirable to have. Not at home and in
London could she have had the advantages she had enjoyed
here. Phœbe was sensible enough—or perhaps we might use
a less complimentary word—worldly enough, to count within
those manifest benefits the advantage of seeing more of Clarence
Copperhead, and of drawing him within the charmed circle of
her influence, and she was grateful to the Mays, for this was
their doing. And then, on the other hand, quite a different
thing, her heart was touched and softened with gratitude to
Reginald for loving her; of all her gratitudes, perhaps this indeed
was the most truly felt. They had given her unbounded
kindness, friendliness, everything that is most sweet to the
solitary; and over and above, as if these were not enough, they
had made her the exquisite present of a heart, the best thing
that can be given or received by man. Phœbe felt herself
penetrated with gratitude for all this, and she resolved that, if
anything she could do could benefit the Mays, the effort on her
part should not be wanting. “Paid by Tozer.” What had been
paid by Tozer? What had her grandfather to do with it. Could
it be he who had lent money to Mr. May? Then Phœbe resolved,
with a glow on her face, he should forgive his debtors.
She went in with her mind fully made up, whatever might
happen, to be the champion of the sufferer, the saviour of the
family. This would show them that their kindness had been
appreciated. This would prove even to Reginald that, though
she would not sacrifice her own prospects by marrying him,
yet that she was grateful to him, to the bottom of her heart. Her
mind was full of generous ardour as she went in. She knew
her power; her grandfather had never yet refused her anything,
never resisted her, and it did not seem likely that he
should begin now.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tozer was by herself in the parlour, dozing over the
fire. She woke up with a little start when Phœbe came in
and smiled at the sight of her.</p>

<p>“I didn't expect as you'd have come so soon,” she said;
“you've broke up early to-night, darling. Couldn't you have
no music? I didn't look for you for an hour or more.”</p>

<p>“You know, grandmamma, it is Mr. Copperhead who teases
me most for music, and he is not here.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, <i>I</i> know,” said the old lady, nodding her head
with many smiles. “I know a deal more about it than you
think for, Phœbe, and don't you think as I disapprove, for it's
quite the other way. But you won't tell me as there ain't
others as cares for music as well as young Copperhead. I've seen
one as couldn't take his eyes off of you while you were playing.”</p>

<p>“Hush, grandmamma; the others like music for music's
sake, or perhaps for my sake; but Mr Copperhead likes it for
his own sake, and therefore he is the one who insists upon it.
But this is not the reason why I have come home so soon.
Mr. May has been taken suddenly ill.”</p>

<p>“Lord bless us!” cried Mrs. Tozer, “deary, deary me!
I'm very sorry, poor gentleman, I hope it ain't anything
serious. Though he's a church parson, he's a very civil-spoken
man, and I see his children drag him into his own house
one day as me and Tozer was passing. I said to Tozer at the
time, you take my word, whatever folks say, a man as lets his
children pull him about like that ain't a bad one. And so he's
ill, poor man! Is there anything as we can do to help, my
dear? They ain't rich, and they've been as kind to you as if
you'd been one of their own.”</p>

<p>“I thought that would be the first thing you would ask me,”
said Phœbe gratefully, giving her a kiss—“dear grandmamma,
it is like your kind heart—and I ran off to see that you were
quite well and comfortable, thinking perhaps if you did not want
me I might go back to poor Ursula for the night.”</p>

<p>To hear her granddaughter call Miss May by her Christian
name was in itself a pleasure to Mrs. Tozer. She gave Phœbe
a hug. “So you shall, my darling, and as for a bottle of good
wine or that, anything as is in the house, you know you're
welcome to it. You go and talk to your grandfather; I'm as
comfortable as I can be, and if you'd like to run back to
that poor child—”</p>

<p>“Not before you are in bed,” said Phœbe, “but if you please
I'll go and talk to grandpapa as you said. There are things in
which a man may be of use.”</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said Mrs. Tozer, doubtfully; “your grandfather
ain't a man as is much good in sickness; but I won't
say as there ain't some things—”</p>

<p>“Yes, grandmamma, I'll take your advice and run and talk
to him; and by the time I come back you will be ready for bed.”</p>

<p>“Do, my dear,” said Mrs. Tozer. She was very comfortable,
and did not care to move just then, and, as Phœbe went away,
looked after her with dreamy satisfaction. “Bless her! there
ain't her match in Carlingford, and the gentlefolks sees it,” said
Mrs. Tozer to herself. But she had no idea how Phœbe's
heart was beating as she went along the dimly-lighted passage,
which led to a small room fitted up by Tozer for himself.
She heard voices in earnest talk as she approached, but this
made her only the more eager to go in, and see for herself
what was going on. There could be no doubt, she felt sure of
it, that the discussion here had some connection with the
calamity <i>there</i>. What it was she had not the slightest idea;
but that somehow the two were connected she felt certain.
The voices were loud as she approached the door.</p>

<p>“I'll find out who done it, and I'll punish him—as sure as
that's my name, though I never put it on that there paper,”
Tozer was saying. Phœbe opened the door boldly, and went
in. She had never seen her grandfather look so unlike himself.
The knot of the big white neckerchief round his neck
was pushed away, his eyes were red, giving out strange lights
of passion. He was standing in front of the fireplace gesticulating
wildly. Though it was now April and the weather very
mild and genial, there were still fires in the Tozer sitting-rooms,
and as the windows were carefully shut, Phœbe felt the atmosphere
stifling. The other person in the room was a serious,
large man, whom she had already seen more than once; one of
the chief clerks in the bank where Tozer kept his account,
who had an old acquaintance with the butterman, and who
was in the habit of coming when the bank had anything to say
to so sure a customer about rates of investment or the value of
money. He was seated at one side of the fire, looking very
grave and shaking his head as the other spoke.</p>

<p>“That is very true, and I don't say anything against it.
But, Mr. Tozer, I can't help thinking there's some one else in
it than Cotsdean.”</p>

<p>“What one else? what is the good of coming here to me
with a pack of nonsense? He's a poor needy creature as hasn't
a penny to bless himself with, a lot of children, and a wife as
drinks. Don't talk to me of some one else. That's the sort of
man as does all the mischief. What, Phœbe! run away to
your grandmother, I don't want you here.”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to interrupt you, grandpapa. Mayn't I
stay? I have something to say to you—”</p>

<p>Tozer turned round and looked at her eagerly. Partly his
own fancy, and partly his wife's more enlightened observations,
had made him aware that it was possible that Phœbe might
one day have something very interesting to reveal. So her
words roused him even in the midst of his pre-occupation.
He looked at her for a second, then he waved his hand and
said,</p>

<p>“I'm busy; go away, my dear, go away; I can't talk to you
now.”</p>

<p>Phœbe gave the visitor a look which perplexed him; but
which meant, if he could but have read it, an earnest entreaty
to him to go away. She said to herself, impatiently, that he
would have understood had he been a woman; but as it was
he only stared with lack-lustre eyes. What was she to do?</p>

<p>“Grandpapa,” she said, decisively, “it is too late for business
to-night. However urgent it may be, you can't do anything
to-night. Why, it is nearly ten o'clock, and most people are
going to bed. See Mr. ——, I mean this gentleman—to-morrow
morning the first thing; for you know, however
anxious you may be, you can't do anything to-night.”</p>

<p>“That is true enough,” he said, looking with staring eyes
from her to his visitor, “and more's the pity. What had to be
done should ha' been done to-day. It should have been done
to-day, sir, on the spot, not left over night like this, to give
the villain time to get away. It's a crime, Phœbe, that's what
it is—that's the fact. It's a crime.”</p>

<p>“Well, grandpapa, I am very sorry; but it will not mend
matters, will it, if sitting up like this, and agitating yourself
like this, makes you ill? That will not do away with the crime.
It is bed-time, and poor grandmamma is dozing, and wondering
what has become of you. Grandpapa——”</p>

<p>“Phœbe, go away, it ain't none of your business; you're
only a bit of a girl, and how can you understand? If you
think I'm going to sit down with it like an old fool, lose my
money, and what is worse nor my money, let my very name be
forged before my eyes—”</p>

<p>Phœbe gave so perceptible a start that Tozer stopped short,
and even the banking-clerk looked at her with aroused curiosity.</p>

<p>“Forged!” she cried, with a gasp of dismay; “is it so bad
as that?” She had never been more near betraying herself,
showing a personal interest more close than was natural.
When she saw the risk she was running, she stopped short and
summoned all her energies. “I thought some one had pilfered
something,” she said with an attempt at a laugh. “I beg your
pardon, grandpapa; but anyhow what can you do to-night?
You are keeping—this gentleman—and yourself out of bed.
Please put it off till to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I think so too,” said the banker's clerk. “I'll come to you
in the morning as I go to the Bank. Perhaps I may have been
wrong; but I think there's more in it than meets the eye.
To-morrow we can have the man Cotsdean up and question him.”</p>

<p>“After he's had time to take himself off,” said Tozer, vehemently.
“You take my word he ain't in Carlingford, not now,
let alone to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Then that shows,” said Phœbe, quietly, “that it is of no
use making yourself ill to-night. Grandpapa, let this gentleman
go—he wants to go; and I have something to say to you.
You can do anything that is necessary to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I think so indeed,” said Mr. Simpson, of the Bank, getting
up at last, “the young lady is quite right. We can't act hastily
in a thing like this. Cotsdean's a man of good character, Mr.
Tozer; all that has to be taken into account—and he is not a
beggar. If he has done it, we can recover something at least;
but if he has been taken advantage of—I think the young lady
is a good counsellor, and that it's much the best to wait till
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Phœbe seized upon her grandfather's arm to restrain him,
and held him back. “Good-night,” she said; “grandpapa, stay
with me, I have something to say to you. Listen; you don't
think me very silly, do you, grandpapa dear?”</p>

<p>“Silly!” he said, listening to the steps of the departing
visitor as they receded along the passage. “What has a chit
like you to do with business? I tell you it'll kill me. Me
a-signing of accommodation bills for a bit of a small shopkeeper
like that Cotsdean! I tell you it'll make an end of me, that will,
unless I gets my money and clears myself afore the world. And
here you've been and sent away Simpson, and who's to manage
for me? I ain't a lawyer to know what to do. Get away, get
away, and leave me to myself, I can't be disturbed with
women-folks when I've got real business in hand.”</p>

<p>“I'll manage for you,” said Phœbe; “you need not stare at
me like that, grandpapa—”</p>

<p>“Go out o' the room this moment, Miss!” he cried furious;
“you! here's a sort of thing for me to put up with. Sam Tozer
wasn't born yesterday that a bit of an impudent girl should
take upon her to do for him. Manage for me! go out o' my
sight; I'm a fool, am I, and in my dotage to have a pack of
women meddling in my affairs?”</p>

<p>Phœbe had never met with such an outburst of coarse anger
in her life before, and it gave her a shock, as such assaults
naturally do to people brought up softly, and used to nothing
but kindness. For a moment she wavered, doubtful whether
she should not proudly abandon him and his affairs altogether;
but this was to abandon her friends too. She mastered herself
accordingly, and the resentment which she could not help
feeling—and stood pale but quiet opposite to the infuriated old
man. His grey eyes seemed to give out sparks of fire. His
hair bristled up on his head like the coat of a wild animal
enraged. He went up and down on the hearth-rug like the
same animal in a cage, shaking his fist at some imaginary
culprit.</p>

<p>“Once I get him, see if I let him go,” he cried, his voice
thick with fast-coming words and the foam of fury. “Let the
bank do as it likes; I'll have him, I will. I'll see justice on
the man as has dared to make free with my name. It ain't
nothing to you, my name; but I've kep' it honest, and out of
folk's mouths, and see if I'll stand disgrace thrown on it now.
A bill on me as never had such a thing, not when I was struggling
to get on! Dash him! damn him!” cried the old man,
transported with rage. When he had come to this unusual and
terrible length, Tozer paused dismayed. He had lost his
temper before in his life; but very seldom had he been betrayed
into anything so desperate as this. He stopped aghast, and
cast a half-frightened look at Phœbe, who stood there so quiet,
subdued out of her usual force, pale and disapproving—his own
grandchild, a pastor's daughter! and he had forgotten himself
thus before her. He blushed hotly, though he was not used to
blushing, and stopped all at once. After such frightful language,
so unbecoming a deacon of Salem, so unlike a consistent
member of the connection, what could he say?</p>

<p>“Grandpapa,” said Phœbe softly, “it is not good to be so
angry; you are made to say things you are sorry for. Will you
listen to me now? Though you don't think it, and perhaps
won't believe it, I have found out something quite by chance—”</p>

<p>He went up to her and clutched her by the arm. “Then
what are you a-standing there for, like a figure in stone? Can't
you out with it, and ease my mind? Out with it, I tell you!
Do you want to drive me out of my senses?”</p>

<p>He was so much excited that he shook her in the hot paroxysm
of returning rage. Phœbe was not frightened, but indignation
made her pale. She stood without flinching, and looked
at him, till poor old Tozer let go his hold, and dropping into a
chair, covered his face with his hands. She was too generous
to take advantage of him, but went on quietly, as if nothing
had occurred.</p>

<p>“Grandpapa, as I tell you, I have found out something by
chance that has to do with the thing that troubles you; but I
don't know quite what it is. Tell me first, and then—is this
the thing?” said Phœbe, curiously, taking up a slip of paper
from the table, a stamped piece of paper, in a handwriting
which seemed horribly familiar to her, and yet strange. Tozer
nodded at her gloomily, holding his head between his hands,
and Phœbe read over the first few words before her with an
aching heart, and eyes that seemed to ache in sympathy. Only
a few words, but what evidence of guilt, what pitiful misery in
them! She did not even think so much of the name on the back,
which was and was not her grandfather's name. The rest of
the bill was written in a hand disguised and changed; but she
had seen a great deal of similar writing lately, and she recognized
it with a sickening at her heart. In the kind of fatherly
flirtation which had been innocently carried on between Phœbe
and her friend's father, various productions of his in manuscript
had been given to her to read. She was said, in the pleasant
social jokes of the party, to be more skilled in interpreting Mr.
May's handwriting than any of his family. She stood and
gazed at the paper, and her eyes filled with tears of pain and
pity. The openness of this self-betrayal, veiled as it was with
a shadow of disguise which could deceive no one who knew
him, went to Phœbe's heart. What could he have done it for?
Mere money, the foolish expenses of every day, or, what would
be more respectable, some vague mysterious claim upon him,
which might make desperate expedients necessary? She stood,
temporarily stupefied, with her eyes full, looking at that pitiful,
terrible, guilty bit of paper, stupefied by the sudden realization
of her sudden guess at the truth—though, indeed, the truth
was so much more guilty and appalling than any guess of
hers.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tozer, “you've seen it, and now what do you
think of it? That's my name, mind you, my name! I hope
the Almighty will grant me patience. Stuck on to what they
calls a kite, an accommodation bill. What do you think of that,
Miss Phœbe? A-a-ah! if I had hold of him—if I had him
under my fists—if I had him by the scruff of the neck!”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa, doesn't it say in the Bible we are to forgive
when harm is done to us?”</p>

<p>Phœbe had begun to tremble all over; for the first time she
doubted her own power.</p>

<p>He got up again, and began to prowl about the table, round
and round, with the same wild look in his eyes.</p>

<p>“I am not one as would go again' Scripture,” he said,
gloomily; “but that's a spiritual meaning as you're too young
to enter into. You don't suppose as Scripture would approve
of crime, or let them escape as had wronged their fellow-creatures?
There wouldn't be no business, no justice, no trade,
on such a rule as that.”</p>

<p>“But, grandpapa—”</p>

<p>“Don't you but me. You've seen me in good spirits and
good temper, Phœbe, my girl; but you don't know old Sam
Tozer when his spirit's up. D—— him!” cried the old man,
striking his hand violently on the table; “and you may tell your
father, as is a Minister, that I said so. The Bible's spiritual;
but there's trade, and there's justice. A man ain't clear of
what he's done because you forgive him. What's the law for
else? Forgive! You may forgive him as fast as you like, but
he's got to be punished all the same.”</p>

<p>“But not by you.”</p>

<p>“By the law!” cried Tozer. His inflamed eyes seemed to
glare upon her, his rough grey hair bristled on his head, a hot
redness spread across his face beneath his fiery eyes, which
seemed to scorch the cheek with angry flames. “The law that
ain't a individual. That's for our protection, whether we like
it or not. What's that got to do with forgiving? Now, looking
at it in a public way, I ain't got no right to forgive.”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa, you have always been so kind, always so good
to everybody. I have heard of so many things you have done—”</p>

<p>“That is all very well,” said Tozer, not without a certain
gloomy complacence, “so long as you don't touch <i>me</i>. But the
moment as you touches me, I'm another man. That's what I
can't bear, nor I won't. Them as tries their tricks upon me
shan't be let off, neither for wife nor child; and don't you think,
my girl, though you're Phœbe, junior, that you are a-going for
to come over me.”</p>

<p>Phœbe could not but shiver in her fright and agitation; but
distressed and excited as she was, she found means to take a
step which was important indeed, though at the moment she
did not fully realize its importance, and did it by instinct only.
She had a handkerchief in her hand, and almost without consciousness
of what she was doing, she crushed up the miserable
bit of paper, which was the cause of so much evil and misery, in
its folds. He was far too impassioned and excited to observe
such a simple proceeding. It was the suggestion of a moment,
carried out in another moment like a flash of lightning. And
as soon as she had done this, and perceived what she had done,
fortitude and comfort came back to Phœbe's soul.</p>

<p>“You will not hear what I have found out, and now I do
not choose to tell you, grandpapa,” she said, with an air of
offence. “Unless you wish to be ill, you will do much better
to go to bed. It is your usual hour, and I am going to grandmamma.
Say good-night, please. I am going out again to
stay all night. Mr. May is ill, and I ought to help poor
Ursula.”</p>

<p>“You go a deal after them Mays,” said Tozer, with a cloud
over his face.</p>

<p>“Yes. I wonder whom else I should go after? Who has
been kind to me in Carlingford except the Mays? Nobody.
Who has asked me to go to their house, and share everything
that is pleasant in it? None of your Salem people, grandpapa.
I hope I am not ungrateful, and whatever happens, or
whatever trouble they are in,” cried Phœbe, fervently, “I shall
stand up for them through thick and thin, wherever I go.”</p>

<p>The old man looked at her with a startled look.</p>

<p>“You speak up bold,” he said; “you won't get put upon
for want of spirit; and I don't know as what you're saying
ain't the right thing—though I don't hold with the Church,
nor parsons' ways. I'd do a deal myself, though you think me
so hard and cross, for folks as has been kind to you.”</p>

<p>“I know you will, grandpapa,” said Phœbe, with a slight
emphasis which startled him, though he did not know why;
and she kissed him before she went to her grandmother, which
she did with a perfectly composed and tranquil mind. It was
astonishing how the crackle of that bit of paper in her handkerchief
calmed and soothed her. She recovered her breath,
her colour, and her spirits. She ran up to her room and
changed her dress, which was silk, for a soft merino one, which
made no rustling; and then she folded the bill carefully, and
put it into the safe keeping of the little purse which she always
carried in her pocket. No one would think of searching for it
there, and she would always have it at hand whatever happened.
When she had made these needful arrangements, she went to
old Mrs. Tozer, and took her comfortably upstairs. Never was
there a more devoted nurse. The old lady chatted cheerfully,
yet sympathetically, of the poor gentleman and his illness, with
the half-satisfaction of an invalid in hearing of some one else
who is ill.</p>

<p>“And be sure you take him some of the port wine as the
doctor ordered, and Tozer paid that dear for. I don't care for
it, not a bit, Phœbe. I'd sooner have it from the grocer's, at
two shillings a bottle. That's what I've always been used to,
when I did take a glass of wine now and again. But I dare
say as Mr. May would like it, poor gentleman.”</p>

<p>When Mrs. Tozer had laid her head, all nodding with white
muslin frills, edged with cotton lace, upon her pillow, Phœbe,
noiseless in her soft merino gown, went back, accompanied by
Martha, to the Parsonage, where Ursula's careworn face lighted
a little at sight of her. Ursula had left her father for the
moment in Betsy's care, to get something that was wanted,
and she stole into the dining-room on hearing of her friend's
arrival, and talked a little in a whisper, though the sick man
was on the upper floor, and could not possibly have heard anything.
Northcote was still there, sitting with Reginald, too
anxious and excited to go away; and they all conversed in
whispers, the three of them talking together for the benefit of
the new-comer.</p>

<p>“Not paralysis; at least, he does not think so; a great
mental shock—but we can't tell a bit what it was—coming
when he was dreadfully tired, and not able to bear it.”</p>

<p>They all spoke together, each of them saying a few words, and
kept close together in the centre of the room, a curious little
half-frightened group, overawed and subdued by the sudden
change and strange calamity dropt into their midst. Phœbe
seemed to bring them new life and hope.</p>

<p>“If it is going to be an illness,” she said, “you gentlemen
had better go home and go to bed, to be able to help us when
we want help. Anyhow, what good can they do, Ursula?
They had much better go to bed.”</p>

<p>Ursula looked at them with a certain regret; though they
could not do much good, it was a relief to come and whisper a
few words to them now and then, giving them news of the
patient. But Phœbe was right, and there was nothing to be
said against her decision. The two young women and the
faithful Betsy were enough, and, indeed, more than enough to
watch over Mr. May.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>A MORNING'S WORK.</h3>


<p>“Go and lie down for an hour,” whispered Phœbe. “I am
not sleepy at all. I have sat up before, and never felt it,
you never did, I can see it in your poor little white face; and
besides, I am steadier, because I am not so anxious. Now go,
Ursula, if you are really fond of me, as you say—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Phœbe! if you think he is a little better. Oh, how
horrible it is to be sleepy, as if you were all body, and had no
heart at all!”</p>

<p>“You have plenty of heart, but you have never been used
to this nursing. Leave your door open, so that I may call
you in a moment. I have sat up often. Now go, to please
me,” said Phœbe. She had another object than mere rest to
her friend, who at last, very much ashamed and crying softly,
yet so weary that nothing on this earth seemed so desirable to
her as sleep, crept to her room, and lay down there as the pale
morning began to dawn. Betsy slept heavily in an easy-chair
outside the door of the sick-room. She was there at hand in
case anything was wanted, but she was happily unconscious
where she was, sleeping the sleep of hard work and a mind undisturbed.
Phœbe had seen that the patient was stirring out
of the dull doze in which his faculties had been entirely stilled
and stupefied. He was rousing to uneasiness, if not to full
consciousness. Two or three times he made a convulsive
movement, as if to raise himself; once his eyes, which were
half open, seemed to turn upon her with a vague glimmer of
meaning. How strangely she felt towards him, as she sat
there in the grey of the morning, sole guardian, sole confidant
of this erring and miserable man! The thought ran through
her with a strange thrill. He was nothing to her, and yet he
was absolutely in her power, and in all heaven and earth there
seemed no one who was capable of protecting him, or cared to
do so, except herself only. She sat looking at him with a
great pity in her mind, determined to be his true protector, to
deliver him from what he himself had done. She had not
realized at first what it was he had done, and indeed it was
only now that its full enormity, or rather its full consequences
(which were the things that affected her most urgently), made
themselves apparent to her. Generalizations are unsafe things;
and whether it was because she was a woman that Phœbe,
passing over the crime, fixed her thoughts upon the punishment,
I do not venture to say; but she did so. After all a
few lines of writing on a bit of paper is not a crime which
affects the imagination of the inexperienced. Had it been a
malicious slander Phœbe would have realized the sin of it
much more clearly; but the copy of her grandfather's signature
did not wound her moral sense in the same way, though it
was a much more serious offence. That Mr. May could have
intended to rob him of the money appeared impossible to her;
and no doubt the borrowing of the signature was wrong—very
wrong. Yes, of course it was horribly, fatally wrong; but
still it did not set her imagination aglow with indignant horror,
as smaller affairs might have done. But the consequences—disgrace,
ruin, the loss of his position, the shame of his profession,
moral death indeed, almost as frightful as if he had
been hanged for murder. She shivered as she sat by him,
veiled by the curtain, and thought of her grandfather's vindictive
fierceness; only she stood between him and destruction,
and Phœbe felt that it was by no legitimate means that she
was doing so, not by her influence over her grandfather as she
had hoped, but only by an unjustifiable expedient which in
itself was a kind of crime. This, however, brought a slight
smile on her face. She took out her little purse from her
pocket, and looked at the bit of paper carefully folded in it.
The faint perfume of the Russia leather had already communicated
itself to the document, which had not been so
pleasant in Tozer's hands. As she looked at it lying peacefully
on her lap, her attention was suddenly called by the
patient, who sat upright and looked furtively about him, with
his hand upon the coverings ready to throw them off. His
ghastly white face peered at her from behind the curtain with
wild eagerness—then relaxed, when he met her eye, into a
kind of idiot smile, a painful attempt to divert suspicion, and
he fell back again with a groan. The trance that had stupefied
him was over; he had recovered some kind of consciousness,
how much or how little she could not tell. His mind now
seemed to be set upon hiding himself, drawing his coverings
over him, and concealing himself with the curtain, at which he
grasped with an excess of force which neutralized itself.</p>

<p>“Mr. May,” said Phœbe, softly. “Mr. May! do you know
me?”</p>

<p>She could not tell what answer he made, or if he made any
answer. He crouched down under the bed-clothes, pulling
them over his face, trying to hide himself from her; from
which she divined that he did recognize her, confused though
his faculties were. Then a hoarse murmuring sound seemed
to come out of the pillow. It was some time before she could
make out what it was.</p>

<p>“Where am I?” he said.</p>

<p>With the lightning speed of sympathy and pity, Phœbe
divined what his terror was. She said, almost whispering,</p>

<p>“At home, in your own bed—at home! and safe. Oh,
don't you know me—I am Phœbe.” Then after a pause,
“Tozer's granddaughter; do you know me now?”</p>

<p>The strange, scared, white-faced spectre shrank under his
covering, till she could see no more of him except two wild
eyes full of terror which was almost madness.</p>

<p>“Listen!” she said eagerly, “try to understand! Oh, Mr.
May, try to understand! I know about it—I know everything,
and you are safe—quite safe; you need not have any fear!”</p>

<p>He did not follow what she said, Phœbe perceived with pain
and terror. Even the impression made by the first sight of
her seemed to fade from his mind. His grasp relaxed upon
the curtains and coverlet; and then the hoarse murmuring
was resumed. Straining all her ears, she made out that he
was not speaking to her or any one, but moaned to himself,
saying the same words over and over again. It took her a
long time to make out even what these words were. When at
last she did make them out they filled the girl with an alarm
beyond words.</p>

<p>“It used to be hanging,” he said. “Hard labour; can I
bear hard labour? And the children—the children! Hard
labour—for life. Hanging—was soon over. The children!
I cannot bear it. I never was put to—hard labour—in all my
life.”</p>

<p>Phœbe was too sick at heart to listen to more. She drew a
little apart, but near enough to be seen by him. If he chose
to spring up, to fling himself from the window, as she had
heard of men doing in delirium, who could restrain him? Not
she, a slight girl, nor Betsy, even if Betsy could be roused to
the danger. She did not know how long the vigil which
followed lasted, but it seemed like years to her; and when at
last she was relieved by the joyful sound of Reginald's voice
and footstep coming up the stairs, she felt disposed to run to
the glass at once, and look if her hair had grown white,
or her countenance permanently changed with the terror.
Reginald, for his part, thought of his father in the second place
only, as children are apt to do; he came up to her first, and
with a thrill in his voice of surprise and emotion, addressed
her hastily by her name.</p>

<p>“Phœbe! is it <i>you</i> who are watching—you, darling?”</p>

<p>“Hush! I sent Ursula to bed; she was so tired. Don't
leave him. I am frightened,” cried Phœbe. “He is wandering
in his mind. Oh, don't leave him, Mr. May!”</p>

<p>“I will do exactly as you tell me,” said Reginald, in a confused
transport of feeling, the very anxiety in his mind helping
to destroy his self-control. He stooped down and kissed
her hands before she could divine what he was about to do.
“Only you or an angel would have done it,” he cried, with
a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>Was it not natural that he should think that some thought
of him had made Phœbe so careful of his father? His heart
was swelling, too full to hold, with a sudden joy, which expanded
the pain, and made that greater too.</p>

<p>“Oh, what does it matter about me? Mr. May, think what
I am saying. Don't leave him for a moment. He might throw
himself out of the window, he might do some harm to himself.
Ah! again!” said Phœbe, trembling.</p>

<p>But this time it was only a convulsive start, nothing more.
The patient dropped down again softly upon his pillows, and
relapsed into his doze, if doze it could be called, in which his
faculties were but half-dormant, and his open eyes contradicted
all the appearances of natural sleep.</p>

<p>When she was relieved from the sick room—and now she had
a double motive in getting away—Phœbe stole softly into the
faded little place where Ursula lay, still fast asleep, though fully
dressed, and bathed her face and strained eyes. “I wonder if
my hair is grey underneath,” she said to herself. “I wonder
nothing has happened to me.” But a great deal had happened
to her. Such a night is rarely encountered by so young a
creature, or such an alarming charge undertaken. And sudden
hot kisses upon little, cold, agitated hands, worn by fatigue to
nervous perception of every touch, are very exciting and strange
to a girl. They had given her a kind of electric shock. She
was not in love with Reginald, and therefore she felt it all the
more, and her heart was still throbbing with the suddenness and
excitement of the incident. And after she had made an effort to
get over this, there remained upon her mind the disturbing
burden of a knowledge which no one shared, and a responsibility
which was very heavy and terrible, and too tremendous for her
slight shoulders. After she had made that hasty toilette, she
sat down for a moment at the foot of the bed on which Ursula lay
sleeping, unconscious of all those mysteries, and tried to think.
It is not an easy process at any time, but after a long night's
watching, terror, and agitation, it seemed more impossible to
Phœbe than it had ever done before. And she had so much
occasion for thought, so much need of the power of judging
clearly. What was she to do?—not to-morrow, or next week,
but now. She had taken the responsibility of the whole upon
herself by the sudden step she had taken last night; but, bold as
she had been, Phœbe was ignorant. She did not know whether
her theft of the bill would really stop the whole proceedings,
as had seemed so certain last night; and what if she was found
out, and compelled to return it, and all her labour lost! A
panic took possession of her as she sat there at the foot of
Ursula's bed, and tried to think. But what is the use of trying
to think? The more you have need of them, the more all
mental processes fail you. Phœbe could no more think than
she could fly. She sat down very seriously, and she rose
up in despair, and, thought being no longer among her possibilities,
resolved to do something at once, without further delay,
which would be a consolation to herself at least. How wonderful
it was to go out in the fresh early morning, and see the
people moving about their work, going up and down with indifferent
faces, quite unconcerned about the day and all it
might bring forth! She went up Grange Lane with a curious
uncertainty as to what she should do next, feeling her own
extraordinary independence more than anything else. Phœbe
felt like a man who has been out all night, who has his own
future all in his hands, nobody having any right to explanation
or information about what he may choose to do, or to expect
from him anything beyond what he himself may please to give.
Very few people are in this absolutely free position, but this was
how Phœbe represented it to herself, having, like all other girls,
unbounded belief in the independence and freedom possessed
by men. Many times in her life she had regarded with envy
this independence, which, with a sigh, she had felt to be impossible.
But now that she had it, Phœbe did not like it. What
she would have given to have gone to some one, almost any one,
and told her dilemma, and put the burden a little off her shoulders!
But she durst not say a word to any one. Very anxious and
pre-occupied, she went up Grange Lane. Home? She did not
know; perhaps she would have thought of something before
she reached the gate of No. 6. And accordingly, when she
had lifted her hand to ring the bell, and made a step aside to
enter, an inspiration came to Phœbe. She turned away from
the door and went on up into the town, cautiously drawing her
veil over her face, for already the apprentices were taking down
the shutters from her uncle's shop, and she might be seen.
Cotsdean's shop was late of opening that morning, and its master
was very restless and unhappy. He had heard nothing more
about the bill, but a conviction of something wrong had crept
into his mind. It was an altogether different sensation from
the anxiety he had hitherto felt. This was no anxiety to speak
of, but a dull pain and aching conviction that all was not right.
When he saw the young lady entering the shop, Cotsdean's
spirits rose a little, for a new customer was pleasant, and though
he thought he had seen her, he did not know who she was.
She was pleasant to look upon, and it was not often that any
one came so early. He came forward with anxious politeness;
the boy (who was always late, and a useless creature, more
expense than he was worth) had not appeared, and therefore
Cotsdean was alone.</p>

<p>“I wanted to speak to you, please,” said Phœbe. “Will
you mind if I speak very plainly, without any ceremony? Mr.
Cotsdean, I am Mr. Tozer's granddaughter, and live with him
at No. 6 in the Lane. I dare say you have often seen me with
Miss May.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes, Miss, certainly,” he said, with a thrill of alarm
and excitement running through him. He felt his knees knock
together under cover of the counter, and yet he did not know
what he feared.</p>

<p>“Will you please tell me frankly, in confidence, about——the
bill which was brought to my grandfather yesterday?”
said Phœbe, bringing out the question with a rush.</p>

<p>Whether she was doing wrong, whether she might bring
insult upon herself, whether it was an interference unwarrantable
and unjustifiable, she could not tell. She was in as great
a fright as Cotsdean, and more anxious still than he was; but
fortunately her agitation did not show.</p>

<p>“What am I to tell you about it, Miss?” said the man,
terrified. “Is it Mr. Tozer as has sent you? Lord help me!
I know as he can sell me up if he has a mind; but he knows it
ain't me.”</p>

<p>“Don't speak so loud,” said Phœbe, trembling too. “Nobody
must hear; and remember, you are never, never to talk
of this to any one else; but tell me plainly, that there may be
no mistake. Is it—Mr. May?”</p>

<p>“Miss Tozer,” said Cotsdean, who was shaking from head to
foot, “if that's your name—I don't want to say a word against
my clergyman. He's stood by me many a day as I wanted him,
and wanted him bad; but as I'm a living man, that money was
never for me; and now he's a-gone and left me in the lurch, and if
your grandfather likes he can sell me up, and that's the truth.
I've got seven children,” said the poor man, with a sob breaking
his voice, “and a missus; and nothing as isn't in the business,
not a penny, except a pound or two in a savings' bank, as would
never count. And I don't deny as he could sell me up; but
oh! Miss, he knows very well it ain't for me.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Cotsdean,” said Phœbe, impressively, “you don't
know, I suppose, that Mr. May had a fit when he received your
note last night?”</p>

<p>“Lord help us! Oh! God forgive me, I've done him wrong,
poor gentleman, if that's true.”</p>

<p>“It is quite true; he is very, very ill; he can't give you any
advice, or assist you in any way, should grandpapa be unkind.
He could not even understand if you told him what has
happened.”</p>

<p>Once more Cotsdean's knees knocked against each other in
the shadow of the counter. His very lips trembled as he stood
regarding his strange visitor with scared and wondering eyes.</p>

<p>“Now listen, please,” said Phœbe, earnestly; “if any one
comes to you about the bill to-day, don't say anything about
<i>him</i>. Say you got it—in the way of business—say anything
you please, but don't mention <i>him</i>. If you will promise me
this, I will see that you don't come to any harm. Yes, I will;
you may say I am not the sort of person to know about business,
and it is quite true. But whoever comes to you remember
this—if you don't mention Mr. May, I will see you safely
through it; do you understand?”</p>

<p>Phœbe leant across the counter in her earnestness. She
was not the kind of person to talk about bills, or to be a satisfactory
security for a man in business; but Cotsdean was a
poor man, and he was ready to catch at a straw in the turbid
ocean of debt and poverty which seemed closing round him.
He gave the required promise with his heart in his mouth.</p>

<p>Then Phœbe returned down the street. Her fatigue began
to tell upon her, but she knew that she dared not give in, or allow
that she was fatigued. However heavy with sleep her eyes
might be, she must keep awake and watchful. Nothing, if she
could help it, must so much as turn the attention of the world
in Mr. May's direction. By this time she was much too deeply
interested to ask herself why she should do so much for Mr.
May. He was her charge, her burden, as helpless in her
hands as a child; and nobody but herself knew anything about it.
It was characteristic of Phœbe's nature that she had no doubt
as to being perfectly right in the matter, no qualm lest she
should be making a mistake. She felt the weight upon her of
the great thing she had undertaken to do, with a certain half-pleasing
sense of the solemnity of the position and of its difficulties;
but she was not afraid that she was going wrong or
suffering her fancy to stray further than the facts justified;
neither was she troubled by any idea of going beyond her sphere
by interfering thus energetically in her friend's affairs. Phœbe
did not easily take any such idea into her head. It seemed
natural to her to do whatever might be wanted, and to
act upon her own responsibility. Her self-confidence reached
the heroic point. She knew that she was right, and she knew
moreover that in this whole matter she alone was right. Therefore
the necessity of keeping up, of keeping alert and vigilant,
of holding in her hand the threads of all these varied complications
was not disagreeable to her, though she fully felt its importance—nay,
almost exaggerated it in her own mind if that
could be. She felt the dangerous character of the circumstances
around her, and her heart was sore with pity for the culprit, or
as she called him to herself the chief sufferer; and yet all the
same Phœbe felt a certain sense of satisfaction in the great role
she herself was playing. She felt equal to it, though she scarcely
knew what was the nest step she ought to take. She was
walking slowly, full of thought, to Tozer's door, pondering upon
this, when the sound of rapid wheels behind roused her attention,
and looking up, surprised, she suddenly saw leaping out
of a dog-cart the imposing figure of Clarence Copperhead, of
whom she had not been thinking at all. He came down with
a heavy leap, leaving the light carriage swinging and quivering
behind him with the shock of his withdrawal.</p>

<p>“Miss Phœbe!” he said, breathless; “here's luck! I came
over to see you, and you are the first person I set eyes on—”</p>

<p>He was rather heavy to make such a jump, and it took away
his breath.</p>

<p>“To see me?” she said, laughing, though her heart began
to stir. “That is very odd. I thought you must have come
to see poor Mr. May, who is so ill. You know—”</p>

<p>“May be hanged!” said the young man; “I mean—never
mind—I don't mean him any harm, though, by Jove, if you
make such a pet of him, I don't know what I shall think. Miss
Phœbe, I've come over post-haste, as you may see; chiefly to see
you; and to try a horse as well,” he added, “which the governor
has just bought. He's a very good 'un to go; and pleased the
governor would be if he knew the use I had put him to,” he
concluded, with a half-laugh.</p>

<p>Phœbe knew as well as he did what that use was. He had
brought his father's horse out for the first time, to carry him
here to propose to her, in spite of his father. This was the
delicate meaning which it amused him to think of. She understood
it all, and it brought a glow of colour to her face; but it
did not steel her heart against him. She knew her Clarence,
and that his standard of fine feeling and mental elevation was
not high.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he said, “I wish I could speak to you, Miss
Phœbe, somewhere better than in the street. Yes, in the garden—that
will do. It ain't much of a place either to make a
proposal in, for that's what I've come to do; but you don't
want me to go down on my knees, or make a fuss, eh? I got
up in the middle of the night to be here first thing and see
you. I never had a great deal to say for myself,” said Clarence,
“you won't expect me to make you fine speeches; but I <i>am</i> fond
of you—awfully fond of you, Phœbe, that's the truth. You
suit me down to the ground, music and everything. There's no
girl I ever met that has taken such a hold upon me as you.”</p>

<p>Phœbe heard him very quietly, but her heart beat loud. She
stood on the gravel between the flower-borders, where the primroses
were beginning to wither, and glanced over her life of the
past and that of the future, which were divided by this moment
like the two beds of flowers; one homely, not very distinguished,
simple enough—the other exalted by wealth to something quite
above mediocrity. Her heart swelled, full as it was with so
many emotions of a totally different kind. She had gained a
great prize, though it might not be very much to look at;
more or less, she was conscious this golden apple had been
hanging before her eyes for years, and now it had dropped into
her hand. A gentle glow of contentment diffused itself all over
her, not transport, indeed, but satisfaction, which was better.</p>

<p>“Mr. Copperhead—” she said, softly.</p>

<p>“No, hang it all, call me Clarence, Phœbe, if you're going to
have me!” he cried, putting out his big hands.</p>

<p>“Grandmamma is looking at us from the window,” she said,
hurriedly, withdrawing a little from him.</p>

<p>“Well, and what does that matter? The old lady won't say
a word, depend upon it, when she knows. Look here, Phœbe,
I'll have an answer. Yes or no?”</p>

<p>“Have you got your father's consent—Clarence?”</p>

<p>“Ah, it is yes then! I thought it would be yes,” he cried,
seizing her in his arms. “As for the governor,” added
Clarence, after an interval, snapping his fingers, “I don't care
<i>that</i> for the governor. When I've set my mind on a thing, it
ain't the governor, or twenty governors, that will stop me.”</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XLII"/>CHAPTER XLII.</h2>
<h3>A GREAT MENTAL SHOCK.</h3>


<p>“Have you any notion what was the cause?”</p>

<p>“None,” said Reginald. “Oh, no, none at all,” said Ursula.
They were all three standing at the door of the sick-room, in
which already a great transformation had taken place. The
doctor had sent a nurse to attend upon the patient. He had
told them that their father was attacked by some mysterious
affection of the brain, and that none of them were equal to the
responsibility of nursing him. His children thus banished had
set the door ajar, and were congregated round it watching what
went on within. They did not know what to do. It was
Northcote who was asking these questions; it was he who was
most active among them. The others stood half-stunned,
wholly ignorant, not knowing what to do.</p>

<p>“I don't think papa is ill at all,” said Janey. “Look how
he glares about him, just as I've seen him do when he was
writing a sermon, ready to pounce upon any one that made a
noise. He is watching that woman. Why should he lie in
bed like that, and be taken care of when he is just as well as I
am? You have made a mistake all the rest of you. I would
go and speak to him, and tell him to get up and not make all
this fuss, if it was me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Janey! hold your tongue,” said Ursula; but she, too,
looked half-scared at the bed, and then turned wistful inquiring
eyes to Northcote. As for Reginald, he stood uncertain,
bewildered, all the colour gone out of his face, and all the
energy out of his heart. He knew nothing of his father's
affairs, or of anything that might disturb his mind. His mind;
all that his son knew of this was, that whatsoever things disturbed
other minds his father had always contemptuously
scouted all such nonsense. “Take some medicine,” Mr. May
had been in the habit of saying. “Mind! you mean digestion,”
was it nothing more than some complicated indigestion that
affected him now?</p>

<p>“Is it anything about—money?” said Northcote.</p>

<p>They all turned and looked at him. The idea entered their
minds for the first time. Yes, very likely it was money.</p>

<p>“We have always been poor,” said Ursula, wistfully. Northcote
took her hand into his; none of them except Ursula herself
paid any attention to this involuntary, almost unconscious
caress, and even to her it seemed a thing of course, and quite
natural that he should be one of them, taking his share in all
that was going on.</p>

<p>“I—am not poor,” he said, faltering. “You must not think
me presumptuous, May. But the first thing to be done is to
get him out of his difficulties, if he is in difficulties—and you
must let me help to do it. I think you and I should go out
and see about it at once.”</p>

<p>“Go—where?” Reginald, like most young people, had
taken little notice of his father's proceedings. So long as
things went smoothly, what had he to do with them? When
there was a pressure for money, he knew he should hear of it,
at least in the shape of reproaches and sneers from his father
at his useless life, and the expenses of the family. But even
these reproaches had died away of late, since Reginald had
possessed an income of his own, and since the revenues of the
Parsonage had been increased by Clarence Copperhead. Reginald
was more helpless than a stranger. He did not know
where to turn. “Do you think we could ask him? I am
almost of Janey's opinion. I don't think he is so ill as he
seems.”</p>

<p>And then they all paused and looked again into the room.
The nurse was moving softly about, putting everything in
order, and Mr. May watched her from the bed with the keenest
attention. His face was still livid and ghastly in colour;
but his eyes had never been so full of eager fire in all the
experience of his children. He watched the woman with a
close attention which was appalling; sometimes he would put
his covering half aside as if with the intention of making a
spring. He was like some imprisoned animal seeing a possibility
of escape. They looked at him, and then at each other,
with a miserable helplessness. What could they do? He was
their father, but they knew nothing about him, and just because
he was their father they were more slow to understand, more
dull in divining his secrets than if he had been a stranger.
When there came at last a suggestion out of the silence, it
was Northcote who spoke.</p>

<p>“I don't see how you can leave him, May. It is plain he
wants watching. I will go if you will let me—if Ursula will
say I may,” said the young man with a little break in his
voice. This roused them all to another question, quite different
from the first one. Her brother and sister looked at
Ursula, one with a keen pang of involuntary envy, the other
with a sharp thrill of pleasurable excitement. Oddly enough
they could all of them pass by their father and leave him out
of the question, more easily, with less strain of mind, than
strangers could. Ursula for her part did not say anything;
but she looked at her lover with eyes in which two big tears
were standing. She could scarcely see him through those
oceans of moisture, bitter and salt, yet softened by the sense
of trust in him, and rest upon him. When he stooped and
kissed her on the forehead before them all, the girl did not
blush. It was a solemn betrothal, sealed by pain, not by
kisses.</p>

<p>“Yes, go,” she said to him in words which were half sobs,
and which he understood, but no one else.</p>

<p>“You perceive,” he said, “it is not a stranger interfering in
your affairs, May, but Ursula doing her natural work for her
father through me—her representative. God bless her! I
am Ursula now,” he said with a broken laugh of joy; then
grew suddenly grave again. “You trust me, May?”</p>

<p>Poor Reginald's heart swelled; this little scene so calmly
transacted under his eyes, would it ever happen for him, or
anything like it? No, his reason told him—and yet; still he
was thinking but little of his father. He had his duty too,
and this happened to be his duty; but no warmer impulse was
in the poor young fellow's heart.</p>

<p>And thus the day went on. It was afternoon already, and
soon the sky began to darken. When his children went into
the room, Mr. May took no notice of them—not that he did
not know them; but because his whole faculties were fixed
upon that woman who was his nurse, and who had all her wits
about her, and meant to keep him there, and to carry out the
doctor's instructions should heaven and earth melt away around
her. She too perceived well enough how he was watching her,
and being familiar with all the ways, as she thought, of the
“mentally afflicted,” concluded in her mind that her new
patient was further gone than the doctor thought.</p>

<p>“I hope as you'll stay within call, sir,” she said significantly
to Reginald; “when they're like that, as soon as they breaks
out they're as strong as giants; but I hope he won't break out,
not to-day.”</p>

<p>Reginald withdrew, shivering, from the idea thus presented
to him. He stole down to his father's study, notwithstanding
the warning she had given him, and there with a sick heart set
to work to endeavour to understand his father—nay, more
than that, to try to find him out. The young man felt a thrill
of nervous trembling come over him when he sat down in his
father's chair and timidly opened some of the drawers. Mr.
May was in many respects as young a man as his son, and
Reginald and he had never been on those confidential terms
which bring some fathers and sons so very close together. He
felt that he had no business there spying upon his father's
privacy. He could not look at the papers which lay before
him. It seemed a wrong of the first magnitude, wrought
treacherously, because of the helplessness of the creature most
concerned. He could not do it. He thrust the papers back
again into the drawer. In point of fact there were no secrets
in the papers, nor much to be found out in Mr. May's private
life. All its dark side might be inferred from, without being
revealed in, the little book which lay innocently on the desk,
and which Reginald looked over, thinking no harm. In it
there were two or three entries which at length roused his
curiosity. Cotsdean, October 10th. Cotsdean, January 12th.
C. &amp; T. April 18th. What did this mean? Reginald remembered
to have seen Cotsdean paying furtive visits in the study.
He recollected him as one of the few poor people for whom his
father had a liking. But what could there be between them?
He was puzzled, and as Betsy was passing the open door at
the time, called her in. The evening was falling quickly, the
day had changed from a beautiful bright morning to a rainy
gusty afternoon, tearing the leaves and blossoms from the
trees, and whirling now and then a shower of snowy petals,
beautiful but ill-omened snow, across the dark window. Beyond
that the firmament was dull; the clouds hung low, and
the day was gone before it ought. When Betsy came in she
closed the door, not fastening it, but still, Reginald felt, shutting
him out too much from the sick-bed, to which he might
be called at any moment. But he was not alarmed by this,
though he remarked it. He questioned Betsy closely as to
his father's possible connection with this man. In such a
moment, confidential, half-whispered interviews are the rule of
a house. Every one has so much to ask; so much to say in
reply; so many particulars to comment upon which the rest
may have forgotten. She would have liked to enter upon the
whole story, to tell how the master was took, and how she
herself had thought him looking bad when he came in; but
even to talk about Cotsdean was pleasant.</p>

<p>“I told Miss Beecham,” said Betsy, “and I told the other
gentleman, Mr. Northcote, as was asking me all about it. It's
months and months since that Cotsdean got coming here—years
I may say; and whenever he came master looked bad.
If you'll believe me, Mr. Reginald, it's money as is at the
bottom of it all.”</p>

<p>“Money? hush, what was that? I thought I heard something
upstairs.”</p>

<p>“Only the nurse, sir, as is having her tea. I'm ready to
take my oath as it's money. I've been in service since I was
nine years old,” said Betsy, “I've had a deal of experience of
gentlefolks, and it's always money as is the thing as sets them
off their head. That's what it is. If that Cotsdean didn't
come here something about money, never you believe me no
more.”</p>

<p>“Cotsdean! a poor shopkeeper! what could he have to do
with my father's affairs?” Reginald was not speaking to the
woman, but drearily to himself. If this was the only clue to
the mystery, what a poor clue it was!</p>

<p>“I dunno, sir,” said Betsy, “it ain't for me to tell; but one
thing I'm sure of—Lord bless us, what's that?”</p>

<p>Reginald rushed to the door, nearly knocking her down as
he pushed her aside with his hand. When they got outside,
it was only the hat-stand in the hall that had fallen, something
having been torn off from it apparently in mad haste, and the
door had opened and shut. Reginald rushed upstairs, where
the nurse was sitting quietly at her tea, the bed-curtains being
drawn.</p>

<p>“All right, sir; he's in a nice sleep,” said that functionary;
“I didn't light no candles, not to disturb him, poor gentleman.”</p>

<p>Reginald tore the curtains aside, then turned and dashed
downstairs, and out into the windy twilight. In that moment
of stillness and darkness the patient had escaped. He could
see a strange figure walking rapidly, already half way up
Grange Lane, and rushed on in pursuit without taking thought
of anything. The sick man had seized upon a long coat which
had been hanging in the hall, and which reached to his heels.
Reginald flew on, going as softly as he could, not to alarm him.
Where could he be going, utterly unclothed except in this big
coat? Was it simply madness that had seized him, nothing
more or less? He followed, with his heart beating loudly.
There seemed nobody about, no one to whom he could make
an appeal to help him, even if he could overtake the rapidly
progressing fugitive. But even while this thought crossed his
mind, Reginald saw another figure, broad and tall, developing
in the distance, coming towards them, which stopped short,
and put out an arm to stop the flight. Even that moment
gave him the advantage, and brought him near enough to make
out that it was Mr. Copperhead.</p>

<p>“The very man I want,” he heard him say with his loud
voice, putting his arm within that of Mr. May, who resisted,
but not enough to attract the attention of the new-comer, as
Reginald came up breathless and placed himself on his father's
other side. The darkness prevented any revelation of the
strange appearance of the fugitive, and Mr. Copperhead was
not lively of perception in respect to people unconnected with
himself.</p>

<p>“You, too,” he cried, nodding at Reginald, “come along.
I've come to save that boy of mine from a little artful—Come,
both of you. The sight of a young fellow like himself will
shame him more than anything; and you, May, you're the
very man I want—”</p>

<p>“Not there, not there, for God's sake!” said Mr. May, with
a hoarse cry, “not there, my God! Reginald! it used to be
hanging. Do you mean to give me up?”</p>

<p>“Hold him fast,” Reginald whispered in desperation, “hold
him fast! It is madness.”</p>

<p>“Lord bless us!” said Mr. Copperhead, but he was a man
who was proud of his strength, and not given to timidity. He
held his captive fast by the arm, while Reginald secured him
on the other side. “Why, what's this, May? rouse yourself
up; don't give in, man. No, you ain't mad, not a bit of you.
Come along, wait here at Tozer's for me, while I do my
business; and then I'll look after <i>you</i>. Come on.”</p>

<p>There was a violent but momentary struggle; then all at
once the struggling man yielded and allowed himself to be
dragged within the garden-door. Was it because an ordinary
policeman, one of the most respectful servants of the law, who
would have saluted Mr. May with the utmost reverence, was
just then coming up? He yielded; but he looked at his son
with a wild despair which made Reginald almost as desperate
as himself in maddening ignorance and terror.</p>

<p>“Ruin! ruin!” he murmured hoarsely, “worse than death.”</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XLIII"/>CHAPTER XLIII.</h2>
<h3>THE CONFLICT.</h3>


<p>The day which had intervened between Phœbe's morning
walk, and this darkling flight along the same road, had been
full of agitation at the house of the Tozers. Phœbe, who
would willingly have spared her lover anything more than the
brief intercourse which was inevitable with her relations, could
find no means of sending him away without breakfast. She
had escaped from him accordingly, weary as she was, to make
arrangements for such a meal as she knew him, even in his
most sentimental mood, to love—a thing which required some
time and supervision, though the house was always plentifully
provided. When she had hastily bathed her face and changed
her dress she came back to the room where she had left him, to
find him in careless conversation with Tozer, who only half-recovered
from the excitement of last night, but much overawed
by a visit from so great a personage, had managed to put
aside the matter which occupied his own thoughts, in order to
carry on a kind of worship of Clarence, who was the son of the
richest man he had ever heard of, and consequently appeared to
the retired butterman a very demigod. Clarence was yawning
loudly, his arms raised over his head in total indifference to
Tozer, when Phœbe came into the room; and the old man
seized upon the occasion of her entrance to perform another
act of worship.</p>

<p>“Ah, here's Phœbe at last. Mr. Copperhead's come in from
the country, my dear, and he's going to make us proud, he is,
by accepting of a bit of breakfast. I tell him it's a wretched
poor place for him as has palaces at his command; but what
we can give him is the best quality, that I answers for—and
you're one as knows how things should be, even if we ain't
grand ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Have you palaces at your command, Clarence?” she said,
with a smile. Notwithstanding the fatigue of the night, the
fresh air and her ablutions, and the agitation and commotion of
her mind, made Phœbe almost more animated and brilliant than
usual. Her eyes shone with the anxiety and excitement of the
crisis, and a little, too, with the glory and delight of success;
for though Clarence Copperhead was not very much to brag of
in his own person, he still had been the object before her for
some time back, and she had got him. And yet Phœbe was
not mercenary, though she was not “in love” with her heavy
lover in the ordinary sense of the word. She went towards
him now, and stood near him, looking at him with a smile.
He was a big, strong fellow, which is a thing most women
esteem, and he was not without good looks; and he would be
rich, and might be thrust into a position which would produce
both honour and advantage; and lastly, he was her own, which
gives even the most indifferent article a certain value in some
people's eyes.</p>

<p>“Palaces? I don't know, but nice enough houses; and you
know you like a nice house, Miss Phœbe. Here, I haven't
said a word to the old gentleman. Tell him; I ain't come all
this way for nothing. You've always got the right words at
your fingers' end. Tell him, and let's get it over. I think I
could eat some breakfast, I can tell you, after that drive.”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa,” said Phœbe, slightly tremulous, “Mr. Copperhead
wishes me to tell you that—Mr. Copperhead wishes you
to know why——”</p>

<p>“Bless us!” cried Clarence with a laugh. “Here is a
beating about the bush! She has got her master, old gentleman,
and that is what she never had before. Look here, I'm
going to marry Phœbe. That's plain English without any
phrases, and I don't know what you could say to better it. Is
breakfast ready? I've earned it for my part.”</p>

<p>“Going to marry Phœbe!” Tozer gasped. He had heard
from his wife that such a glory was possible; but now, when
it burst upon him, the dazzling delight seemed too good to be
true. It thrust the forgery and everything out of his head,
and took even the power of speech from him. He got up and
gazed at the young people, one after the other, rubbing his
hands, with a broad grin upon his face; then he burst forth
all at once in congratulation.</p>

<p>“God bless you, sir! God bless you both! It's an honour
as I never looked for. Rising in the world was never no
thought of mine; doing your duty and trusting to the Lord is
what I've always stood by; and it's been rewarded. But she's
a good girl, Mr. Copperhead; you'll never regret it, sir. She's
that good and that sensible, as I don't know how to do without
her. She'll do you credit, however grand you may make her;
and if it's any comfort to you, as she's connected with them as
knows how to appreciate a gentleman—” said Tozer, breaking
down in his enthusiasm, his voice sinking into a whisper in the
fulness of his heart.</p>

<p>“Grandpapa!” said Phœbe, feeling sharply pricked in her
pride, with a momentary humiliation, “there are other things
to be thought of,” and she gave him a look of reproach which
Tozer did not understand, but which Clarence did vaguely.
Clarence, for his part, liked the homage, and was by no means
unwilling that everybody should perceive his condescension
and what great luck it was for Phœbe to have secured him.
He laughed, pleased to wave his banner of triumph over her,
notwithstanding that he loved her. He <i>was</i> very fond of her,
that was true; but still her good fortune in catching him was,
for the moment, the thing most in his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Well, old gentleman,” he said, “you ain't far wrong there.
She <i>is</i> a clever one. We shall have a bad time of it with the
governor at first; for, of course, when there's no money and no
connections, a man like the governor, that has made himself,
ain't likely to be too well pleased.”</p>

<p>“As for money, Mr. Copperhead, sir,” said Tozer with
modest pride, “I don't see as there's anything to be said
against Phœbe on that point. Her mother before her had a
pretty bit of money, though I say it, as shouldn't—”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes—yes,” said Clarence. “To be sure; but a little
bit of coin like that don't count with us. The governor deals
in hundreds of thousands; he don't think much of your little
bits of fortunes. But I don't mind. She suits me down to
the ground, does Phœbe; and I don't give that for the governor!”
cried the young man valiantly. As for Phœbe herself, it is impossible
to imagine any one more entirely put out of her place,
and out of all the comfort and satisfaction in her own initiative
which she generally possessed, than this young woman was,
while these two men talked over her so calmly. It is doubtful
whether she had ever been so set aside out of her proper position
in her life, and her nerves were overstrained and her bodily
strength worn out, which added to the sense of downfall. With
almost a touch of anger in her tone she, who was never out of
temper, interrupted this talk.</p>

<p>“I think breakfast is ready, grandpapa. Mr. Clarence Copperhead
wants some refreshment after his exertions, and in
preparation for the exertions to come. For I suppose your
papa is very likely to follow you to Carlingford,” she added,
with a low laugh, turning to her lover. “I know Mr. Copperhead
very well, and I should not like my first meeting with him
after I had thwarted all his views.”</p>

<p>“Phœbe! you don't mean to desert me? By Jove! I'll
face him and twenty like him if you'll only stand by me,” he
cried; which was a speech that made amends.</p>

<p>She suffered him to lead her into breakfast less formally than
is the ordinary fashion, and his hand on her trim waist did not
displease the girl. No; she understood him, knew that he was
no great things; but yet he was hers, and she had always
meant him to be hers, and Phœbe was ready to maintain his
cause in the face of all the world.</p>

<p>The breakfast was to Clarence's taste, and so was the company—even
old Tozer, who sat with his mouth agape in admiration
of the young potentate, while he recounted his many
grandeurs. Clarence gave a great deal of information as to
prices he had paid for various things, and the expenses of his
living at Oxford and elsewhere, as he ate the kidneys, eggs,
and sausages with which Phœbe's care had heaped the table.
They had no <i>pâté de foie gras</i>, it is true, but the simple fare
was of the best quality, as Tozer had boasted. Mrs. Tozer did
not come downstairs to breakfast, and thus Phœbe was alone
with the two men, who suited each other so much better than
she could have hoped. The girl sat by them languidly, though
with a beating heart, wondering, as girls will wonder sometimes,
if all men were like these, braggards and believers in
brag, worshippers of money and price. No doubt, young men
too marvel when they hear the women about them talking
across them of <i>chiffons</i>, or of little quarrels and little vanities.
Phœbe had more brains than both of her interlocutors put
together, and half-a-dozen more added on; but she was put
down and silenced by the talk. Her lover for the moment had
escaped from her. She could generally keep him from exposing
himself in this way, and turn the better side of him to the
light; but the presence of a believer in him turned the head of
Clarence. She could not control him any more.</p>

<p>“A good horse is a deuced expensive thing,” he said; “the
governor gave a cool hundred and fifty for that mare that
brought me over this morning. He bought her from Sir
Robert; but he didn't know, Phœbe, the use I was going to
put her to. If he'd known, he'd have put that hundred and
fifty in the sea rather than have his beast rattled over the
country on such an errand.” Here he stopped in the midst of
his breakfast, and looked at her admiringly. “But I don't
repent,” he added. “I'd do it again to-morrow if it wasn't
done already. If you stand by me, I'll face him, and twenty
like him, by Jove!”</p>

<p>“You don't say nothing,” said her grandfather. “I wouldn't
be so ungrateful. Gentlemen like Mr. Copperhead ain't picked
up at every roadside.”</p>

<p>“They ain't, by Jove!” said Clarence; “but she's shy, that's
all about it,” he added, tenderly; “when we're by ourselves,
I don't complain.”</p>

<p>Poor Phœbe! She smiled a dismal smile, and was very glad
when breakfast was over. After that she took him into the
garden, into the bright morning air, which kept her up, and
where she could keep her Clarence in hand and amuse him,
without allowing this revelation of the worst side of him.
While they were there, Martha admitted the visitor of yesterday,
Mr. Simpson from the Bank, bringing back to Phœbe's
mind all the other matter of which it had been full.</p>

<p>“Don't you think you ought to go and see about the horse
and the dog-cart?” she said suddenly, turning to her lover
with one of those sudden changes which kept the dull young
man amused. “You don't know what they may be about.”</p>

<p>“They can't be up to much,” said Clarence. “Thank you,
Miss Phœbe, I like you better than the mare.”</p>

<p>“But you can't be here all day, and I can't be here all day,”
she said. “I must look after grandmamma, and you ought to
go down and inquire after poor Mr. May—he is so ill. I have
been there all night, helping Ursula. You ought to go and
ask for him. People don't forget all the duties of life because—because
a thing of this sort has happened—”</p>

<p>“Because they've popped and been accepted,” said graceful
Clarence. “By Jove! I'll go. I'll tell young May. I'd like
to see his face when I tell him the news. You may look as
demure as you like, but you know what spoons he has been
upon you, and the old fellow too—made me as jealous as King
Lear sometimes,” cried the happy lover, with a laugh. He
meant Othello, let us suppose.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Clarence! But go, please go. I must run to
grandmamma.”</p>

<p>Mr. Simpson had gone in, and Phœbe's heart had begun to
beat loudly in her throat; but it was not so easy to get rid of
this ardent lover, and when at last he did go, he was slightly
sulky, which was not a state of mind to be encouraged. She
rushed upstairs to her grandmother's room, which was over the
little room where Tozer sat, and from which she could already
hear sounds of conversation rapidly rising in tone, and the
noise of opening and shutting drawers, and a general rummage.
Phœbe never knew what she said to the kind old woman, who
kissed and wept over her, exulting in the news.</p>

<p>“I ain't been so pleased since my Phœbe told me as she was
to marry a minister,” said Mrs. Tozer, “and this is a rise in
life a deal grander than the best of ministers. But, bless your
heart, what shall I do without you?” cried the old woman,
sobbing.</p>

<p>Presently Tozer came in, with an air of angry abstraction,
and began to search through drawers and boxes.</p>

<p>“I've lost something,” he answered, with sombre looks, to
his wife's inquiry. Phœbe busied herself with her grandmother,
and did not ask what it was. It was only when he
had searched everywhere that some chance movement directed
his eyes to her. She was trembling in spite of herself. He
came up to her, and seized her suddenly by the arm. “By
George!” he cried, “I'm in a dozen minds to search you!”</p>

<p>“Tozer! let my child alone. How dare you touch her—her
as is as good as Mr. Copperhead's lady? What's she got to
do with your dirty papers? Do you think Phœbe would
touch them—with a pair of tongs?” cried the angry grandmother.</p>

<p>Phœbe shrank with all the cowardice of guilt. Her nerves
were unstrung by weariness and excitement. And Tozer, with
his little red eyes blazing upon her, was very different in this
fury of personal injury, from the grandfather of the morning,
who had been ready to see every virtue in her.</p>

<p>“I believe as you've got it!” he cried, giving her a shake.
It was a shot at a venture, said without the least idea of its
truth; but before the words had crossed his lips, he felt with a
wild passion of rage and wonder that it was true. “Give it
up, you hussy!” he shrieked, with a yell of fury, his face convulsed
with sudden rage, thickly and with sputtering lips.</p>

<p>“Tozer!” cried his wife, flinging herself between them,
“take your hands off the child. Run, run to your room, my
darling; he's out of his senses. Lord bless us all, Sam, are
you gone stark staring mad?”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa,” said Phœbe, trembling, “if I had it, you may
be sure it would be safe out of your way. I told you I knew
something about it, but you would not hear me. Will you
hear me now? I'll make it up to you—double it, if you like.
Grandmamma, it is a poor man he would drive to death if he is
not stopped. Oh!” cried Phœbe, clasping her hands, “after
what has happened this morning, will you not yield to me?
and after all the love you have shown me? I will never ask
anything, not another penny. I will make it up; only give in
to me, give in to me—for once in my life! Grandpapa! I never
asked anything from you before.”</p>

<p>“Give it up, you piece of impudence! you jade! you d—d
deceitful——”</p>

<p>He was holding her by the arm, emphasizing every new
word by a violent shake, while poor old Mrs. Tozer dropped
into a chair, weeping and trembling.</p>

<p>“Oh! it ain't often as he's like this; but when he is, I can't
do nothing with him, I can't do nothing with him!” she
cried.</p>

<p>But Phœbe's nerves strung themselves up again in face
of the crisis. She shook him off suddenly with unexpected
strength, and moving to a little distance, stood confronting
him, pale but determined.</p>

<p>“If you think you will get the better of me in this way, you
are mistaken,” she said. “I am not your daughter; how dare
you treat me so? Grandmamma, forgive me. I have been up
all night. I am going to lie down,” said Phœbe. “If grandpapa
has anything more to say against me, he can say it to
Clarence. I leave myself in his hands.”</p>

<p>Saying this, she turned round majestically, but with an
anxious heart, and walked away to her room, every nerve in
her trembling. When she got there, Phœbe locked the door
hastily, in genuine terror; and then she laughed, and then she
cried a little. “And to think it was here all the time!” she
said to herself, taking out the little Russia leather purse out of
her pocket. She went into the closet adjoining her room, and
buried it deep in her travelling trunk which was there, relieving
herself and her mind of a danger. Then—Phœbe did what
was possibly the most sensible thing in the world, in every
point of view. She went to bed; undressed herself quietly,
rolled up her hair, and lay down with a grateful sense of ease
and comfort. “When Clarence comes back he will be disappointed;
but even for Clarence a little disappointment will
be no harm,” said the sensible young woman to herself. And
what comfort it was to lie down, and feel all the throbs and
pulses gradually subsiding, the fright going off, the satisfaction
of success coming back, and gradually a slumberous, delicious
ease stealing over her. Of all the clever things Phœbe had
done in her life, it must be allowed that there was not one so
masterly as the fact that she, then and there, went to sleep.</p>

<p>All this had taken up a good deal of time. It was twelve
when Mr. Simpson of the bank disturbed the lovers in the
garden, and it was one o'clock before Phœbe put a stop to all
Tozer's vindictive plans by going to bed. What he said to
Mr. Simpson, when he went back to him, is not on record.
That excellent man of business was much put out by the long
waiting, and intimated plainly enough that he could not allow
his time to be thus wasted. Mr. Simpson began to think that
there was something very strange in the whole business.
Tozer's house was turned upside down by it, as he could hear
by the passionate voices and the sound of crying and storming
in the room above; but Cotsdean was secure in his shop, apparently
fearing no evil, as he had seen as he passed, peering in
with curious eyes. What it meant he could not tell; but it
was queer, and did not look as if the business was straight-forward.</p>

<p>“When you find the bill, or make up your mind what to do,
you can send for me,” he said, and went away, suspicious and
half-angry, leaving Tozer to his own devices. And the afternoon
passed in the most uncomfortable lull imaginable. Though
he believed his granddaughter to have it, he looked again over
all his papers, his drawers, his waste-basket, every corner he
had in which such a small matter might have been hid; but
naturally his search was all in vain. Clarence returned in the
afternoon, and was received by poor old Mrs. Tozer, very
tremulous and ready to cry, who did not know whether she
ought to distrust Phœbe or not, and hesitated and stumbled
over her words till the young man thought his father had come
in his absence, and that Phœbe had changed her mind. This
had the effect of making him extremely eager and anxious, and
of subduing the bragging and magnificent mood which the
triumphant lover had displayed in the morning. He felt himself
“taken down a peg or two,” in his own fine language. He
went to the Parsonage and tried very hard to see Ursula, to
secure her help in case anything had gone wrong, and then to
Reginald, whose vexation at the news he felt sure of, and
hoped to enjoy a sight of. But he could see no one in the
absorbed and anxious house. What was he to do? He wandered
about, growing more and more unhappy, wondering if
he had been made to fling himself into the face of fate for no
reason, and sure that he could not meet his father without
Phœbe's support. He could not even face her relations. It
was very different from the day of triumph he had looked for;
but, as Phœbe had wisely divined, this disappointment, and all
the attending circumstances, did not do him any harm.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when Northcote called. He too
had acted on the information given by Betsy, and had gone to
Cotsdean, who made him vaguely aware that Tozer had some
share in the business in which Mr. May was involved, and who,
on being asked whether it could be set right by money, grew
radiant and declared that nothing could be easier. But when
Northcote saw Tozer, there ensued a puzzling game at cross
purposes, for Tozer had no notion that Mr. May had anything
to do with the business, and declined to understand.</p>

<p>“I ain't got nothing to do with parsons, and if you'll take
my advice, sir, it 'ud be a deal better for you to give 'em up
too. You're a-aggravating the connection for no good, you
are,” said Tozer, surely by right of his own troubles and perplexities,
and glad to think he could make some one else uncomfortable
too.</p>

<p>“I shall do in that respect as I think proper,” said Northcote,
who was not disposed to submit to dictation.</p>

<p>“Fact is, he's a deal too well off for a minister,” Tozer said
to his wife when the young man disappeared, “they're too independent
that sort; and I don't know what he means by his
Mays and his fine folks. What have we got to do with Mr. May?”</p>

<p>“Except that he's been good to the child, Tozer; we can't
forget as he's been very good to the child.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dash the child!” cried the old man, infuriated; “if
you say much more I'll be sorry I ever let you see her face.
What has she done with my bill?”</p>

<p>“Bill? if it's only a bill what are you so put out about!”
cried Mrs. Tozer. “You'll have dozens again at Christmas, if
that is all you want.”</p>

<p>But the laugh was unsuccessful, and the old man went back
to his room to nurse his wrath and to wonder what had come to
him. Why had his granddaughter interfered in his business,
and what had he to do with Mr. May?</p>

<p>Phœbe got up refreshed and comfortable when it was time
for the family tea, and came down to her lover, who had come
back, and was sitting very dejected by old Mrs. Tozer's side.
She was fresh and fair, and in one of her prettiest dresses,
having taken pains for him; and notwithstanding Tozer's
lowering aspect, and his refusal to speak to her, the meal
passed over very cheerfully for the rest of the party, and the
two young people once more withdrew to the garden when
it was over. The presence of Clarence Copperhead protected
Phœbe from all attack. Her grandfather dared not fly out
upon her as before, or summon her to give up what she had
taken from him. Whatever happened, this wonderful rise in
life, this grand match could not be interfered with. He withdrew
bitter and exasperated to his own den, leaving his poor
wife crying and wretched in the family sitting-room. Mrs.
Tozer knew that her husband was not to be trifled with, and
that, though the circumstances of Phœbe's betrothal subdued
him for the moment, this effect in all probability would not
last; and she sat in terror, watching the moments as they
passed, and trembling to think what might happen when the
young pair came in again, or when Clarence at last went away,
leaving Phœbe with no protection but herself. Phœbe, too,
while she kept her dull companion happy, kept thinking all the
while of the same thing with a great tremor of suppressed
agitation in her mind; and she did not know what was the
next step to take—a reflection which took away her strength.
She had taken the bill from her trunk again and replaced it in
her pocket. It was safest carried on her person, she felt; but
what she was to do next, even Phœbe, so fruitful in resources,
could not say. When Northcote came back in the evening she
felt that her game was becoming more and more difficult to
play. After a brief consultation with herself, she decided that
it was most expedient to go in with him, taking her big body-guard
along with her, and confiding in his stupidity not to find
out more than was indispensable. She took Northcote to her
grandfather's room, whispering to him on the way to make
himself the representative of Cotsdean only, and to say nothing
of Mr. May.</p>

<p>“Then you know about it?” said Northcote amazed.</p>

<p>“Oh, hush, hush!” cried Phœbe; “offer to pay it on Cotsdean's
part, and say nothing about Mr. May.”</p>

<p>The young man looked at her bewildered; but nodded his
head in assent, and then her own young man pulled her back
almost roughly, and demanded to know what she meant by
talking to that fellow so. Thus poor Phœbe was between two
fires. She went in with a fainting yet courageous heart.</p>

<p>“Pay the money!” said Tozer, who by dint of brooding
over it all the day had come to a white heat, and was no
longer to be controlled. “Mr. Northcote, sir, you're a minister,
and you don't understand business no more nor women do.
Money's money—but there's more than money here. There's
my name, sir, as has been made use of in a way!—me go signing
of accommodation bills! I'd have cut off my hand sooner.
There's that girl there, she's got it. She's been and stolen it
from me, Mr. Northcote. Tell her to give it up. You may
have some influence, you as is a minister. Tell her to give it
up, or, by George, she shall never have a penny from me!
I'll cut her off without even a shilling. I'll put her out o' my
will—out o' my house.”</p>

<p>“I say, Phœbe,” said Clarence, “look here, that's serious,
that is; not that I mind a little pot of money like what the
poor old fellow's got; but what's the good of throwing anything
away?”</p>

<p>“Make her give it up,” cried Tozer hoarsely, “or out of this
house she goes this very night. I ain't the sort of man to be
made a fool of. I ain't the sort of man—Who's this a-coming?
some more of your d—d intercessors to spoil justice,” cried
the old man, “but I won't have 'em. I'll have nothing to say
to them. What, who? Mr. Copperhead's father? I ain't
ashamed to meet Mr. Copperhead's father; but one thing at a
time. Them as comes into my house must wait my time,”
cried the butterman, seeing vaguely the group come in, whom
we left at his doors. “I'm master here. Give up that bill,
you brazen young hussy, and go out of my sight. How dare
you set up your face among so many men? Give it up!” he
cried, seizing her by the elbow in renewed fury. The strangers,
though he saw them enter, received no salutation from him.
There was one small lamp on the table, dimly lighted, which
threw a faint glow upon the circle of countenances round, into
which came wondering the burly big Copperhead, holding fast
by the shoulder of Mr. May, whose ghastly face, contorted
with wild anxiety, glanced at Tozer over the lamp. But the
old man was so much absorbed at first that he scarcely saw
who the new-comers were.</p>

<p>“What's all this about?” said Mr. Copperhead. “Seems
we've come into the midst of another commotion. So you're
here, Clar! it is you I want, my boy. Look here, Northcote,
take hold, will you? there's a screw loose, and we've got to
get him home. Take hold, till I have had a word with
Clarence. That's a thing that won't take long.”</p>

<p>Clarence cast a glance at Phœbe, who even in her own
agitation turned and gave him a tremulous smile of encouragement.
The crisis was so great on all sides of her that Phœbe
became heroic.</p>

<p>“I am here,” she said, with all the steadiness of strong
emotion, and when he had received this assurance of support,
he feared his father no more.</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” he said almost with alacrity. He was
afraid of nothing with Phœbe standing by.</p>

<p>“Make her give me up my bill,” said Tozer; “I'll hear
nothing else till this is settled. My bill! It's forgery; that's
what it is. Don't speak to me about money! I'll have him
punished. I'll have him rot in prison for it. I'll not cheat
the law—You people as has influence with that girl, make
her give it me. I can't touch him without the bill.”</p>

<p>Mr. May had been placed in a chair by the two young men
who watched over him; but as Tozer spoke he got up, struggling
wildly, almost tearing himself out of the coat by which they
held him. “Let me go!” he said. “Do you hear him? Rot
in prison! with hard labour; it would kill me! And it used
to be hanging! My God—my God! Won't you let me go?”</p>

<p>Tozer stopped short, stopped by this passion which was
greater than his own. He looked wonderingly at the livid
face, the struggling figure, impressed in spite of himself.
“He's gone mad,” he said. “Good Lord! But he's got
nothing to do with it. Can't you take him away?”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa,” said Phœbe in his ear, “here it is, your bill;
it was <i>he</i> who did it—and it has driven him mad. Look! I
give it up to you; and there he is—that is your work. Now
do what you please—”</p>

<p>Trembling, the old man took the paper out of her hand.
He gazed wondering at the other, who somehow moved in his
excitement by a sense that the decisive moment had come,
stood still too, his arm half-pulled out of his coat, his face
wild with dread and horror. For a moment they looked at
each other in a common agony, neither the one nor the other
clear enough to understand, but both feeling that some tremendous
crisis had come upon them. “He—done it!” said
Tozer appalled and almost speechless. “<i>He</i> done it!” They
all crowded round, a circle of scared faces. Phœbe alone stood
calm. She was the only one who knew the whole, except the
culprit, who understood nothing with that mad confusion in
his eyes. But he was overawed too, and in his very madness
recognized the crisis. He stood still, struggling no longer,
with his eyes fixed upon the homely figure of the old butterman,
who stood trembling, thunderstruck, with that fatal piece
of paper in his hand.</p>

<p>Tozer had been mad for revenge two moments before—almost
as wild as the guilty man before him—with a fierce
desire to punish and make an example of the man who had
wronged him. But this semi-madness was arrested by the
sight of the other madman before him, and by the extraordinary
shock of this revelation. It took all the strength out of him.
He had not looked up to the clergyman as Cotsdean did, but
he had looked up to the gentleman, his customer, as being
upon an elevation very different from his own, altogether above
and beyond him; and the sight of this superior being, thus
humbled, maddened, gazing at him with wild terror and agony,
more eloquent than any supplication, struck poor old Tozer to
the very soul. “God help us all!” he cried out with a broken,
sobbing voice. He was but a vulgar old fellow, mean, it might
be, worldly in his way; but the terrible mystery of human
wickedness and guilt prostrated his common soul with as
sharp an anguish of pity and shame as could have befallen the
most heroic. It seized upon him so that he could say or do
nothing more, forcing hot and salt tears up into his old eyes,
and shaking him all over with a tremor as of palsy. The
scared faces appeared to come closer to Phœbe, to whom these
moments seemed like years. Had her trust been vain? Softly,
but with an excitement beyond control, she touched him on
the arm.</p>

<p>“That's true,” said Tozer, half-crying. “Something's got
to be done. We can't all stand here for ever, Phœbe; it's him
as has to be thought of. Show it to him, poor gentleman, if
he ain't past knowing; and burn it, and let us hear of it no
more.”</p>

<p>Solemnly, in the midst of them all, Phœbe held up the paper
before the eyes of the guilty man. If he understood it or not,
no one could tell. He did not move, but stared blankly at her
and it. Then she held it over the lamp and let it blaze and
drop into harmless ashes in the midst of them all. Tozer
dropped down into his elbow-chair sniffing and sobbing. Mr.
May stood quite still, with a look of utter dulness and stupidity
coming over the face in which so much terror had been. If he
understood what had passed, it was only in feeling, not in
intelligence. He grew still and dull in the midst of that
strange madness which all the time was only half-madness, a
mixture of conscious excitement and anxiety with that which
passes the boundaries of consciousness. For the moment he
was stilled into stupid idiotcy, and looked at them with vacant
eyes. As for the others, Northcote was the only one who
divined at all what this scene meant. To Reginald it was
like a scene in a pantomime—bewildering dumb show, with no
sense or meaning in it. It was he who spoke first, with a
certain impatience of the occurrence which he did not understand.</p>

<p>“Will you come home, sir, now?” he said. “Come home,
for Heaven's sake! Northcote will give you an arm. He's very
ill,” Reginald added, looking round him pitifully in his ignorance;
“what you are thinking of I can't tell—but he's ill and—delirious.
It was Mr. Copperhead who brought him here
against my will. Excuse me, Miss Beecham—now I must take
him home.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Phœbe. The tears came into her eyes as she
looked at him; he was not thinking of her at the moment, but
she knew he had thought of her, much and tenderly, and she
felt that she might never see him again. Phœbe would have
liked him to know what she had done, and to know that what
she had done was for him chiefly—in order to recompense him
a little, poor fellow, for the heart he had given her, which she
could not accept, yet could not be ungrateful for. And yet
she was glad, though there was a pang in it, that he should
never know, and remain unaware of her effort, for his own
sake; but the tears came into her eyes as she looked at him,
and he caught the gleam of the moisture which made his heart
beat. Something moved her beyond what he knew of; and
his heart thrilled with tenderness and wonder; but how should
he know what it was?</p>

<p>“Give my love to Ursula,” she said. “I shall not come to-night
as she has a nurse, and I think he will be better. Make
her rest, Mr. May—and if I don't see her, say good-bye to her
for me——”</p>

<p>“Good-bye?”</p>

<p>“Yes, good-bye—things have happened—Tell her I hope she
will not forget me,” said Phœbe, the tears dropping down her
cheeks. “But oh, please never mind me, look at him, he is
quite quiet, he is worn out. Take him home.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing else to be done,” said poor Reginald,
whose heart began to ache with a sense of the unknown which
surrounded him on every side. He took his father by the arm,
who had been standing quite silent, motionless, and apathetic.
He had no need for any help, for Mr. May went with him at a
touch, as docile as a child. Northcote followed with grave
looks and very sad. Tozer had been seated in his favourite
chair, much subdued, and giving vent now and then to something
like a sob. His nerves had been terribly shaken. But
as he saw the three gentlemen going away, nature awoke in the
old butterman. He put out his hand and plucked Northcote
by the sleeve. “I'll not say no to that money, not now, Mr.
Northcote, sir,” he said.</p>

<h3>PHŒBE'S LAST TRIAL.</h3>


<p>“Now if you please,” said Mr. Copperhead. “I think it's
my turn. I wanted May to hear what I had got to say, but
as he's ill or mad, or something, it is not much good. I can't
imagine what all these incantations meant, and all your play,
Miss Phœbe, eyes and all. That sort of thing don't suit us
plain folks. If you don't mind following your friends, I want
to speak to old Tozer here by himself. I don't like to have
women meddling in my affairs.”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa is very tired, and he is upset,” said Phœbe.
“I don't think he can have any more said to him to-night.”</p>

<p>“By George, but he shall though, and you too. Look here,”
said Mr. Copperhead, “you've taken in my boy Clarence here.
He's been a fool, and he always was a fool; but you're not a
fool, Miss Phœbe. You know precious well what you're
about. And just you listen to me; he shan't marry you, not
if he breaks his heart over it. I ain't a man that thinks much
of breaking hearts. You and he may talk what nonsense you
like, but you shan't marry my boy; no, not if there wasn't
another woman in the world.”</p>

<p>“He has asked me,” said Phœbe; “but I certainly did not
ask him. You must give your orders to your son, Mr. Copperhead.
You have no right to dictate to me. Grandpapa, I
think you and I have had enough for to-night.”</p>

<p>With this Phœbe began to close the shutters, which had
been left open, and to put away books and things which were
lying about. Tozer made a feeble attempt to stop her energetic
proceedings.</p>

<p>“Talk to the gentleman, Phœbe, if Mr. Copperhead 'as anything
to say to you—don't, don't you go and offend him, my
dear!” the old man cried in an anxious whisper; and then he
raised himself from the chair, in which he had sunk exhausted
by the unusual commotions to which he had been subjected.
“I am sure, sir,” Tozer began, “it ain't my wish, nor the wish
o' my family, to do anything as is against your wishes—”</p>

<p>“Grandpapa,” said Phœbe, interrupting him ruthlessly,
“Mr. Copperhead's wishes may be a rule to his own family,
but they are not to be a rule to yours. For my part I won't
submit to it. Let him take his son away if he pleases—or if
he can,” she added, turning round upon Clarence with a smile.
“Mr. Clarence Copperhead is as free as I am to go or to
stay.”</p>

<p>“By Jove!” cried that young man, who had been hanging
in the background, dark and miserable. He came close up
to her, and caught first her sleeve and then her elbow; the
contact seemed to give him strength. “Look here, sir,” he
said, ingratiatingly, “we don't want to offend you—<i>I</i> don't
want to fly in your face; but I can't go on having coaches for
ever, and here's the only one in the world that can do the
business instead of coaches. Phœbe knows I'm fond of her,
but that's neither here nor there. Here is the one that can
make something of me. I ain't clever, you know it as well as
I do—but she is. I don't mind going into parliament, making
speeches and that sort of thing, if I've got her to back me up.
But without her I'll never do anything, without her you may
put me in a cupboard, as you've often said. Let me have her,
and I'll make a figure, and do you credit. I can't say any
fairer,” said Clarence, taking the rest of her arm into his grasp,
and holding her hand. He was stupid—but he was a man,
and Phœbe felt proud of him, for the moment at least.</p>

<p>“You idiot!” cried his father, “and I was an idiot too to
put any faith in you; come away from that artful girl. Can't
you see that it's all a made-up plan from beginning to end?
What was she sent down here for but to catch you, you oaf,
you fool, you! Drop her, or you drop me. That's all I've got
to say.”</p>

<p>“Yes, drop me, Clarence,” said Phœbe, with a smile; “for in
the mean time you hurt me. See, you have bruised my arm.
While you settle this question with your father, I will go to
grandmamma. Pardon me, I take more interest in her than in
this discussion between him and you.”</p>

<p>“You shan't go,” cried her lover, “not a step. Look here,
sir. If that's what it comes to, her before you. What you've
made of me ain't much, is it? but I don't mind what I go in
for, as long as she's to the fore. Her before you.”</p>

<p>“Is that your last word?” said Mr. Copperhead.</p>

<p>“Yes.” His son faced him with a face as set and cloudy as
his own. The mouth, shut close and sullen, was the same in
both; but those brown eyes which Clarence got from his
mother, and which were usually mild in their expression, looking
out gently from the ruder face to which they did not seem
to belong, were now, not clear, but muddy with resolution,
glimmering with dogged obstinacy from under the drooping
eyelids. He was not like himself; he was as he had been that
day when Mr. May saw him at the Dorsets, determined, more
than a match for his father, who had only the obstinacy of his
own nature, not that dead resisting force of two people to
bring to the battle. Clarence had all the pertinacity that was
not in his mother, to reinforce his own. Mr. Copperhead
stared at his son with that look of authority, half-imperious,
half-brutal, with which he was in the habit of crushing all who
resisted him; but Clarence did not quail. He stood dull and
immovable, his eyes contracted, his face stolid, and void of all
expression but that of resistance. He was not much more
than a fool, but just by so much as his father was more reasonable,
more clear-sighted than himself, was Clarence stronger
than his father. He held Phœbe by the sleeve, that she might
not escape him; but he faced Mr. Copperhead with a dull
determination that all the powers of earth could not shake.</p>

<p>For the moment the father lost his self-control.</p>

<p>“Then I'll go,” he said, “and when you've changed your
mind, you can come to me; but—” here he swore a big oath,
“mind what you're about. There never was a man yet but repented
when he set himself against me.”</p>

<p>Clarence made no answer. Talking was not in his way.
And Mr. Copperhead showed his wondering apprehension of a
power superior to his own, by making a pause after he had
said this, and not going away directly. He stopped and tried
once more to influence the rebel with that stare. “Phœbe—Phœbe—for
God's sake make him give in, and don't go against
Mr. Copperhead!” cried Tozer's tremulous voice, shaken with
weakness and anxiety. But Phœbe did not say anything.
She felt in the hesitation, the pause, the despairing last effort
to conquer, that the time of her triumph had nearly come.
When he went away, they all stood still and listened to his
footsteps going along the passage and through the garden.
When he was outside he paused again, evidently with the idea
of returning, but changed his mind and went on. To be left
like this, the victors on a field of domestic conflict, is very
often not at all a triumphant feeling, and involves a sense of
defeat about as bad as the reality experienced by the vanquished.
Phœbe, who was imaginative, and had lively feeling, felt a cold
shiver go over her as the steps went away one by one, and
began to cry softly, not knowing quite why it was; but
Clarence, who had no imagination, nor any feelings to speak of,
was at his ease and perfectly calm.</p>

<p>“What are you crying for?” he said, “the governor can do
what he likes. I'd marry you in spite of a hundred like him.
He didn't know what he was about, didn't the governor, when
he tackled <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“But, Clarence, you must not break with your father, you
must not quarrel on my account—”</p>

<p>“That's as it may be,” he said, “never you mind. When it's
cleverness that's wanted, it's you that's wanted to back me up—but
I can stick to my own way without you; and my way is
this,” he said, suddenly lifting her from the ground, holding her
waist between his two big hands, and giving her an emphatic
kiss. Phœbe was silenced altogether when this had happened.
He was a blockhead, but he was a man, and could stand up for
his love, and for his own rights as a man, independent of the
world. She felt a genuine admiration for her lout at that
moment; but this admiration was accompanied by a very chill
sense of all that might be forfeited if Mr. Copperhead stood out.
Clarence, poor and disowned by his father, would be a very
different person from the Clarence Copperhead who was going
into parliament, and had “a fine position” in prospect. She did
not form any resolutions as to what she would do in that case,
for she was incapable of anything dishonourable; but it made
her shiver as with a cold icy current running over; and as for
poor old Tozer he was all but whimpering in his chair.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord!” he cried. “A great man like Mr. Copperhead
affronted in my 'umble 'ouse. It's what I never thought to see.
A friend of the connection like that—your father's leading
member. Oh, Phœbe, it was an evil day as brought you here to
make all this mischief! and if I had known what was going
on!” cried Tozer, almost weeping in his despair.</p>

<p>“You are tired, grandpapa,” said Phœbe. “Don't be frightened
about us. Mr. Copperhead is very fond of Clarence, and
he will give in; or if he doesn't give in, still we shall not be
worse off than many other people.” But she said this with a
secret panic devouring her soul, wondering if it was possible
that such a horrible revolution of circumstances and change of
everything she had looked for, could be. Even Clarence was
silenced, though immovable. He went away soon after, and betook
himself to his room at the Parsonage, where all his possessions
still were, while Phœbe attended upon her grandmother,
whose agitation and fear she calmed without saying much.
Tozer, quite broken down, retired to bed; and when they were
all disposed of, Phœbe went out to the garden, and made a
mournful little promenade there, with very serious thoughts.
If Clarence was to be cast off by his father what could she do
with him? It was not in Phœbe to abandon the stupid lover,
who had stood up so manfully for her. No, she must accept
her fate however the balance turned; but if this dreadful change
happened what should she do with him? The question penetrated,
and made her shiver to the depths of her soul; but never
even in imagination did she forsake him. He was hers now,
come good or ill; but the prospect of the ill was appalling to
her. She went up and down the garden-path slowly in the
silence, looking up to the stars, with her heart very full. Phœbe
felt that no usual burden had been put upon her. Last night
her occupation had been one of the purest charity, and this
Providence had seemed to recompense in the morning, by dropping
at her very feet the prize she had long meant to win; but
now she was down again after being lifted up so high, and a
great part of its value was taken out of that prize. Was she
mercenary or worldly-minded in her choice? It would be hard
to say so, for she never questioned with herself whether or not
she should follow Clarence into obscurity and poverty, if things
should turn out so. She would never abandon him, however
bad his case might be; but her heart sunk very low when she
thought of her future with him, without the “career” which
would have made everything sweet.</p>

<p>Mr. Copperhead, too, had very serious thoughts on this subject,
and sat up long drinking brandy-and-water, and knitting
his brows, as he turned the subject over and over in his mind,
recognizing with disgust (in which nevertheless there mingled a
certain respect) that Clarence would not yield, he was as obstinate
as himself, or more so. He had gone to the inn, where he
was alone, without any of his usual comforts. It was perhaps
the first time in his prosperous life that he had ever been really
crossed. Joe had never attempted to do it, nor any of the first
family. They had married, as they had done everything else,
according to his dictation; and now here was his useless son,
his exotic plant, his Dresden china, not only asserting a will of
his own, but meaning to have it; and showing a resolution, a
determination equal to his own. His mother had never shown
anything of this. She had yielded, as every one else had yielded
(Mr. Copperhead reflected), to whatever he ordered. Where had
the boy got this unsuspected strength? A kind of smile broke
unawares over the rich man's face, as he asked himself this question,
a smile which he chased away with a frown, but which
nevertheless had been there for a moment roused by a subtle suggestion
of self-flattery. Where, but from himself, had his gentleman-son
(as the millionnaire proudly held him to be) got that
strength of obstinacy? He chased the thought and the smile
away with a frown, and went to bed gloomily nursing his wrath;
but yet this suggestion which he himself had made was more
flattering to himself than words can say. As for Clarence, the
only other person deeply concerned, after he had asked for Mr.
May, and expressed his regret to learn how ill he was, the young
man smoked a cigar on the doorsteps, and then went peaceably,
without either care or anxiety, to bed, where he slept very
soundly till eight o'clock next morning, which was the hour at
which he was called, though he did not always get up.</p>

<p>When Mr. Copperhead began the new day, he began it with
a very unwise idea, quickly carried out, as unwise ideas generally
are. Feeling that he could make nothing of his son, he
resolved to try what he could make of Phœbe; a young woman,
nay, a bit of a girl not more than twenty, and a minister's
daughter, brought up in reverence of the leading member—any
resistance on her part seemed really incredible. He could not
contemplate the idea of giving up all the cherished plans of
his life by a melodramatic renunciation of his son. To give up
Clarence whom he had trained to be the very apex and crowning
point of his grandeur, was intolerable to him. But Mr.
Copperhead had heard before now of young women, who, goaded
to it, had been known to give up their lover rather than let
their lover suffer on their account, and if this had ever been
the case, surely it might be so in the present instance. Had
he not the comfort of the Beecham family in his hands?
Could not he make the Crescent Chapel too hot to hold them?
Could he not awaken the fears of scores of other fathers very
unlikely to permit their favourite sons to stray into the hands
of pastors' daughters? There was nothing indeed to be said
against Mr. Beecham, but still it would be strange if Mr. Copperhead,
out and away the richest man in the community, could
not make the Crescent too hot to hold him. He went down
the Lane from the “George,” where he had slept, quite early
next morning, with this purpose full in his head, and, as good
luck (he thought) would have it, found Phœbe, who had been
restless all night with anxiety, and had got up early, once more
walking up and down the long garden-path, reflecting over all
that had happened, and wondering as to what might happen
still. What a piece of luck it was! He was accustomed to
have fortune on his side, and it seemed natural to him. He
went up to her with scarcely a pause for the usual salutations,
and plunged at once into what he had to say.</p>

<p>“Miss Phœbe, I am glad to find you alone. I wanted a word
with you,” he said, “about the affair of last night. Why
shouldn't you and I, the only two sensible ones in the business,
settle it between ourselves? Old Tozer is an old ass, begging
your pardon for saying so, and my son is a fool—”</p>

<p>“I do not agree to either,” said Phœbe gravely, “but never
mind, I will certainly hear what you have to say.”</p>

<p>“What I have to say is this. I will never consent to let
my son Clarence marry you.” Here he was interrupted by a
serious little bow of assent from Phœbe, which disconcerted
and angered him strangely. “This being the case,” he resumed
more hotly, “don't you think we'd better come to terms,
you and me? You are too sensible a girl, I'll be bound, to
marry a man without a penny, which is what he would be.
He would be properly made an end of, Miss Phœbe, if he
found out, after all his bravado last night, that you were the
one to cast him off after all.”</p>

<p>“He cannot find that out,” said Phœbe with a smile; “unfortunately
even if I could have done it under brighter circumstances
my mouth is closed now. I desert him now, when
he is in trouble! Of course you do not know me, so you are
excused for thinking so, Mr. Copperhead.”</p>

<p>The rich man stared. She was speaking a language which
he did not understand. “Look here, Miss Phœbe,” he said,
“let's understand each other. High horses don't answer with
me. As for deserting him when he's in trouble, if you'll give
him up—or desert him, as you call it—he need never be in
trouble at all. You can stop all that. Just you say no to
him, and he'll soon be on his knees to me to think no more of
it. You know who I am,” Mr. Copperhead continued with a
concealed threat. “I have a deal of influence in the connection,
though I say it that shouldn't, and I'm very well looked on in
chapel business. What would the Crescent do without me?
And if there should be an unpleasantness between the minister
and the leading member, why, you know, Miss Phœbe, no one
better, who it is that would go to the wall.”</p>

<p>She made no answer, and he thought she was impressed by
his arguments. He went on still more strongly than before.
“Such a clever girl as you knows all that,” said Mr. Copperhead,
“and suppose you were to marry Clarence without a
penny, what would become of you? What would you make
of him? He is too lazy for hard work, and he has not brains
enough for anything else. What would you make of him if
you had him? That's what I want to know.”</p>

<p>“And that is just what I can't tell you,” said Phœbe smiling.
“It is a very serious question. I suppose something will turn
up.”</p>

<p>“What can turn up? You marry him because he is going
into parliament, and could give you a fine position.”</p>

<p>“I confess,” said Phœbe with her usual frankness, “that I did
think of his career; without that the future is much darker,
and rather depressing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you see that! A poor clod of a fellow that can't
work, and will be hanging upon you every day, keeping you
from working—that you will never be able to make anything
of.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Copperhead,” said Phœbe sweetly, “why do you tell
all this to me? Your mere good sense will show you that I
cannot budge. I have accepted him being rich, and I cannot
throw him over when he is poor. I may not like it—I don't
like it—but I am helpless. Whatever change is made, it cannot
be made by me.”</p>

<p>He stared at her in blank wonder and dismay. For a moment
he could not say anything. “Look here,” he faltered at
last, “you thought him a great match, a rise in the world for
you and yours; but he ain't a great match any longer. What's
the use then of keeping up the farce? You and me understand
each other. You've nothing to do but to let him off; you're
young and pretty, you'll easily find some one else. Fools are
plenty in this world,” he added, unable to refrain from that
one fling. “Let him off and all will be right. What's to
prevent you? I'd not lose a moment if I were you.”</p>

<p>Phœbe laughed. She had a pretty laugh, soft yet ringing
like a child's. “You and I, I fear, are no rule for each other,”
she said. “Mr. Copperhead, what prevents me is a small thing
called honour, that is all.”</p>

<p>“Honour! that's for men,” he said hastily, “and folly for
them according as you mean it; but for women there's no such
thing, it's sham and humbug; and look you here, Miss Phœbe,”
he continued, losing his temper, “you see what your father
will say to this when you get him into hot water with his
people! There's more men with sons than me; and if the
Crescent ain't too hot to hold him within a month—Do you
think I'll stand it, a beggarly minister and his belongings
coming in the way of a man that could buy you all up, twenty
times over, and more!”</p>

<p>The fury into which he had worked himself took away Mr.
Copperhead's breath. Phœbe said nothing. She went on by
his side with soft steps, her face a little downcast, the suspicion
of a smile about her mouth.</p>

<p>“By George!” he cried, when he had recovered himself,
“you think you can laugh at me. You think you can defy
me, you, a bit of a girl, as poor as Job!”</p>

<p>“I defy no one,” said Phœbe. “I cannot prevent you from
insulting me, that is all; which is rather hard,” she added, with
a smile, which cost her an effort, “seeing that I shall have to
drag your son through the world somehow, now that you have
cast him off. He will not give me up, I know, and honour
prevents me from giving him up. So I shall have hard work
enough, without any insults from you. It is a pity,” said
Phœbe, with a sort of sympathetic regret for herself so badly
used. “I could have made a man of him. I could have
backed him up to get on as well as most men; but it will certainly
be uphill work now.”</p>

<p>She did not look at the furious father as she spoke. She
was quite calm, treating it reflectively, regretfully, as a thing
past and over. Mr. Copperhead tried to burst forth again in
threats and objurgations; but in spite of himself, and though
she never said another word, the big, rich, noisy man was
silenced. He went away, threatening to appeal to her father,
which Phœbe, with a last effort, begged him smilingly to do.
But this was the last of which she was capable. When she
had closed the door after him, she rushed upstairs to her room,
and cried bitterly. Everything was very dark to her. If he
did appeal to her father, the appeal would spread confusion
and dismay through the pastor's heart and family; and what
was to become of herself, with Clarence on her hands, who
could do nothing that was useful, and could earn neither his
own living nor hers? All this was very terrible to Phœbe, and
for a moment she contemplated the unheard of step of having
a headache, and staying upstairs. But she reflected that her
poor old grandfather had done <i>his</i> duty, at no small sacrifice,
according to her bidding, yesterday; and she bathed her eyes
heroically, and collected her strength and went down to breakfast
as usual. It was her duty, which she must do.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Copperhead, he took a long walk, to reflect upon
all the circumstances, which were complicated enough to cause
him much trouble. He could not give up his cherished scheme,
his Member of Parliament, his crown of glory. It was what
he had been looking forward to for years. He tried to realize
the failure of his hopes, and could not—nay, would not, feeling
it more than he could bear. No; without his gentleman son,
his University man, his costly, useless production, who was
worth so much money to him, yet brought in nothing, he felt
that he must shrink in the opinion of all his friends, even of
his own sons, the “first family,” who had so envied, sneered
at, undervalued Clarence, yet had been forced to be civil to
him, and respect their father's imperious will as he chose that
it should be respected. What a sorry figure he should cut
before all of them if he cast off Clarence, and had to announce
himself publicly as foiled in all his plans and hopes! He
could not face this prospect; he shrank from it as if it had
involved actual bodily pain. The men who would laugh at his
failure were men of his own class, to whom he had bragged at
his ease, crowing and exulting over them, and he felt that he
could not face them if all his grand anticipations collapsed.
There was nothing for it but to give in. And on the other
hand this girl Phœbe was a very clever girl, able not only to
save the expense of coaches, but to cram the boy, and keep
him up better than any coach could do. She could make his
speeches for him, like enough, Mr. Copperhead thought, and
a great many reasons might be given to the world why she
had been chosen instead of a richer wife for the golden
boy. Golden girls, as a general rule, were not of so much
use. “Fortune ain't worth thinking of in comparison with
brains. It was brains I wanted, and I've bought 'em dear; but
I hope I can afford it,” he almost heard himself saying to an
admiring, envious assembly; for Mr. Copperhead so far deserved
his success that he could accept a defeat when it was
necessary, and make the best of it. When he had nearly
ended his walk, and had reached in his thoughts to this point,
he met his son, who was walking up from the Parsonage to
No. 6 in the Lane. Clarence looked cheerful enough as he
walked along, whistling under his breath, towards his love;
but when he saw his father, a change came over his face. Once
more his eyelids drooped over his eyes, and those muddy brown
orbs got fixed in dull obstinacy; once more his upper lip shut
down sullen and fast upon the lower. The entire expression
of his face changed. Mr. Copperhead saw this afar off, from
the moment his son perceived him, and the sight gave to all
his thinking that force which reality gives to imagination; the
risk he was running became doubly clear.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Clarence,” he said.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir,” responded the other, with lowering
brows and close-shut mouth.</p>

<p>“I suppose you were coming to the George to me? Come
along, I've had no breakfast; and let's hope, my boy, that
you're in a better mind than last night.”</p>

<p>“Look here, sir,” said Clarence; “you might as well ask
one of those houses to walk with you to the George, and show
a better mind. I'm of one mind, and one only. I'll marry
Phœbe Beecham, whether you like it or not, and no other
woman in this world.”</p>

<p>“Is that your last word?” said the father, curiously repeating,
without being aware of it, his question of the previous
night.</p>

<p>“That's my last word,” said the son, contemplating his
father sullenly from under the heavy lids of his obstinate eyes.</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Mr. Copperhead; “then come along to
breakfast, for I'm hungry, and we can talk it over there.”</p>



<h2><a id="CHAPTER_XLV"/>CHAPTER XLV.</h2>
<h3>THE LAST.</h3>


<p>This is how Phœbe's difficulties ended. Contrary to her
every expectation, Mr. Copperhead made a great brag of her
powers wherever he went. “Money is money,” he said, “but
brains is brains, all the same—we can't get on without 'em—and
when you want to make a figure in the world, sir, buy a
few brains if they fall in your way—that's my style. I've done
with stupid ones up till now; but when I see there's a want of
a clever one, I ain't such a fool as to shut my eyes to it. They
cost dear, but I'm thankful to say I can afford that, ay, and a
good deal more.” Thus everything was satisfactorily arranged.
Tozer and his wife cried together for joy on the wedding-day,
but they did not expect to be asked to that ceremony, being
well aware that Phœbe, having now completely entered into
the regions of the great, could not be expected to have very
much to say to them. “Though I know, the darling, as she'd
just be the same if she was here, and wouldn't let nobody look
down upon you and me,” said the old woman.</p>

<p>“She's a wonderful girl, she is,” said old Tozer. “Wind us
all round her little finger, that's what she could do—leastways,
except when there was principle in it, and there I stood firm.
But I've done things for Phœbe as I wouldn't have done for
no other breathing, and she knew it. I wouldn't give in to
her tho' about church folks being just as good as them as is
more enlightened. That's agin' reason. But I've done things
for 'em along of her!—Ah! she's a wonderful girl is Phœbe—Phœbe,
Junior, as I always call her. There ain't her match
between here and London, and that's what I'll always
say.”</p>

<p>But we will not try to describe the glory and joy that filled
Mr. Beecham's house in the Terrace, when Mrs. Clarence
Copperhead went back there with all their friends to the
wedding-breakfast, which was in the very best style, and
regardless of expense. Even at that moment it gave Phœbe a
little pang to see her mother in the bright colours which she
loved, but which made her so much pinker and fatter than was
needful. Little Mrs. Copperhead, in dim neutral tints, looked
like a little shadow beside the pastor's buxom wife, and was
frightened and ill at ease and sad to the heart to lose her boy,
who had been all she possessed in the world. Sophy Dorset,
specially asked for the purpose with Ursula May, who was a
bridesmaid, looked on with much admiration at the curious
people, so rich, so fine, and so overwhelming, among whom her
father had found it so remarkable to meet not one person whom
he knew. “Now, Ursula,” she said, “if you had played your
cards properly that beautiful bridegroom and that nice little
house in Mayfair, and the privilege, perhaps, of writing M.P.
after your name some time or other, might all have been yours
instead of Miss Beecham's. Why did you let her carry off the
prize?”</p>

<p>“Cousin Sophy!” cried Ursula indignantly. “As if I ever
thought of him as a prize! But I know you are only laughing
at me. The strange thing is that she likes him, though I am
sure she knew very well that Reginald—Oh, when one thinks
how many people there are in this world who do not get what
they wish most—and how many people there are—” Ursula
paused, involved in her own antithesis, and Sophy ended it for
her with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Who do—and the one is no happier than the other, most
times, little Ursula; but you don't understand that, and as you
are going to be one of the blessed ones, you need not take to
making reflections; that is my privilege, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Cousin Sophy, why were not you one of those blessed
ones too?” cried Ursula, clasping her arms suddenly round her
kind friend. This, be it understood, was after the breakfast
was over, and when, in the deep gloom which generally
concludes a wedding day, everybody had gone home. The two
were in a magnificent large bedchamber in Portland Place, in
the vast silent mansion of the Copperheads, where at present
there was nothing more cheerful than the bridegroom's soft-eyed
mother, taking herself dreadfully to task for not being
happy, and trying not to cry, though there was to be a great
dinner and entertainment that night.</p>

<p>“Don't you know?” said Sophy, putting her aside with a
certain proud coldness, and a momentary laugh, “he I loved
proved false; that is to say, in simple language, he turned out
so poor a creature that it is very good of me not to despise
humanity for his sweet sake. Never mind. If all had gone
well, and he had been a real man instead of the sham image of
one, I don't suppose I should have ever been among the blessed
ones. Anne is, who never thought of such mysteries at all;
and so you will be, my little Ursula—very happy. I am sure
of it—though how you can manage to be happy, my dear,
marrying a man who is not a good Churchman, it is not for me
to say.”</p>

<p>“Cousin Sophy, have I been brought up in a way to make me
so fond of Churchmen?” said Ursula solemnly. She could
not have told how much or how little she knew about her
father's behaviour, and the “shock to his mental system;” but
vaguely and by instinct there was a great deal that she did
know.</p>

<p>“You have been behind the scenes too much perhaps,” said
Sophy Dorset, shrugging her shoulders, “but don't think any
worse of the world than you ought, if you can't think very
much better. No class is good or bad, Ursula. Men are but
men all over the world.”</p>

<p>This made Ursula cry, though it is difficult to say why. She
thought it cynical, and probably so will the reader. Perhaps
Sophy Dorset abandoned the cause of mankind too easily, as
most people of her temperament and age are disposed to do.
Anyhow the evening entertainment took place and was very
fine, and every honour was done to Clarence Copperhead's marriage,
especially by his mother, who appeared in the most lovely
satin that eyes ever saw, and diamonds—and almost succeeded
all the evening in keeping herself from crying, but not entirely.
She did break down when the health of bridegroom and bride
was drunk as it ought to be; but recovered herself hastily
when the mother on the other side gave her a kiss of sympathy.
Though it was an honest kiss it filled poor little Mrs. Copperhead's
mind with the most unchristian feelings, and gave her
strength to keep up for the rest of the evening, and do her duty
to the last. Nevertheless Phœbe was the best of daughters-in-law,
and ended by making her husband's mother dependent on
her for most of the comforts of her life. And Clarence got
into Parliament, and the reader, perhaps (if Parliament is
sitting), may have had the luck to read a speech in the morning
paper of Phœbe's composition, and if he ever got the secret of
her style would know it again, and might trace the course of a
public character for years to come by that means. But this
secret is one which no bribe nor worldly inducement will ever
tempt our lips to betray.</p>

<p>Northcote was released from the charge of Salem Chapel
directly after these events, by the return of the minister safe
and sound from his holiday, to the great delight of the congregation,
though they had not been very fond of their old
pastor before. Now they could not sufficiently exult over the
happy re-instalment. “The other one never crossed our doors
from the day he came till now as he's going away,” said one
indignant member; “nor took no more notice of us chapel
folks nor if we were dirt beneath his feet.” “That time as the
Meeting was held, when he spoke up again' the sinecure, was
the only time as my mind was satisfied,” cried another. “And
a deal came of it after, making friends with the very man he
had abused.” “All his friends was Church folks,” said a
third; “he was a wolf in sheep's clothing, that's what I calls
him; and a poor moralist as a preacher, with never a rousing
word in them things as he called his sermons. We're well rid
of the likes of him, though he may be clever. I don't give
much for that kind of cleverness; and what's the good of you,
minister or not minister, if you can't keep consistent and stick
to your own side.” The chorus was so strong that the echo of
it moved Tozer, who was a kind of arch-deacon and leading
member too, in his way, where he sat twiddling his thumbs in
his little room. “I'm one as is qualified to give what you may
call a casting vote,” said Tozer, “being the oldest deacon in
Salem, and one as has seen generations coming and going.
And as for Church and Chapel, I've served 'em both, and seen
the colour of their money, and there's them as has their obligations
to me, though we needn't name no names. But this I
will say, as I'm cured of clever men and them as is thought
superior. They ain't to be calculated upon. If any more o'
them young intellectuals turns up at Carlingford, I'll tell him
right out, 'You ain't the man for my money.' I'll say to him
as bold as brass, 'I've been young, and now I'm old, and it's
my conviction as clever young men ain't the sort for Salem.
We want them as is steady-going, and them as is consistent;
good strong opinions, and none o' your charity, that's what we
wants here.'” Now Tozer had loved clever young men in his
day more well than wisely, as everybody knew, and this deliverance
carried all the more weight in consequence, and was
echoed loudly by one general hum of content and applause.</p>

<p>Northcote took this very quietly, but he retired, after he had
married Ursula, from the office of pastor, for which he was not
fitted, and from the Liberation Society, and various other
societies, coming to see that Disestablishment was not a panacea
for national evils any more than other things. He was in the
habit of quoting his brother-in-law, Reginald May, as the best
man he knew; but this did not make him a Churchman; for
naturally he could not say the same of other members of the
same class and family. He was shaken out of his strong
opinions; but it is doubtful how far this was good for him, for
he was a man of warlike disposition, and not to have something
which he could go to the stake for—something which he could
think the devil's own stronghold to assail, was a drawback to
him, and cramped his mental development; but he was happy
in his home with his pretty Ursula, which is probably all the
reader will care to know. He paid Tozer's hundred and fifty
pounds. And he made no inquiries, and tried not to ask himself
what all that strange scene had meant—and whatever it
did mean it was over for ever, and nobody asked any further
questions or made any revelations on the subject. As for Mr.
May, his mysterious illness went on for some time, the doctors
never venturing to put any name to it. It was “mental shock,”
and perhaps aberration, though he was sane enough to calm
down after that incomprehensible scene. Mr. Simpson of the
Bank had a good guess at the secret of the enigma, but even
Tozer got hazy about it after a while, and though he knew that
he had done Mr. May a wonderful service, could scarcely have
told what it was—and neither, when it was all over, could the
culprit have told. He got better and worse for about a year,
and then he died, his strength failing him without any distinct
reason, no one could tell how. Reginald got the living and
stepped into his father's place, making a home for the children,
which sharp Janey rules over, not so softly or steadily as Ursula,
with a love of theories and experiments not quite consistent
with the higher graces of housekeeping, yet with an honest
meaning through it all. As the times are so unsettled, and no
one can tell what may become within a year of any old
foundation, the trustees have requested Reginald to retain his
chaplaincy at the old College; so that he is in reality a pluralist,
and almost rich, though they say the hardest-worked man in
Carlingford. He has his vagaries too, which no man can live
without, but he is the kindest guardian to his brothers and
sisters, and bears with Janey's freaks with exemplary gentleness.
And he has a curate, whom in the course of nature
Janey will probably marry—though this has not yet been
revealed to either party, who have reached only the first stage
of hating each other up to this time. It is not thought in the
family that Reginald will ever marry. She was never worthy
of him, the sisters say; but he thinks differently, as yet at
least. However he is young, and things may mend.</p>
